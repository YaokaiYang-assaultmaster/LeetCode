- grep method1, using -e to specify 2 patterns for 2 kinds of phone numbers seperately.

```
grep -e '\(^[0-9]\{3\}-[0-9]\{3\}-[0-9]\{4\}$\)' -e '\(^([0-9]\{3\})[ ]\{1\}[0-9]\{3\}-[0-9]\{4\}$\)' file.txt
```

- grep method2, using -e to specify a pettern that match both kinds of phone numbers using or, i.e.`\|`.
```
grep -e '\(^\([0-9]\{3\}-\|([0-9]\{3\})[ ]\{1\}\)[0-9]\{3\}-[0-9]\{4\}$\)' file.txt
```

Brief synax of regex in bash:
1. Use `\` to escape next one trailing character, which means the character is going to be interpreted literally.
2. `^` is used to denote the beginning of a line.
3. `$` is used to denote the end of a line.
4. `{n}` is used to denote to match exactly n times of the previous occurance/regex. Don't forget to use `\` to escape `{` and `}`.
5. `(...)` is used to group regex/pattern together. Don't forget to use `\` to excape `(` and `)`.
6. `*` is used to match any times of the preceding occurance/regex, including 0 times.
7. `[]` is used to includes a set of character to be matched for single regex. e.g. `[xyz]` matches one of x, y or z.
8. Sometimes `^` negates the meaning of the following regex, e.g. `[^a-z]` matches anything character except a to z.
