# Solution1: Case by case check

Considering the tic-tac-toe problem, were the board to be valid, there are following possibilities:

1. The number of `X`s in the board should always be the same of one mroe than the number of `O`s, since `X` is always the first move.    
2. If `X` wins, the number of `X` should be one more than the number of `O`, since `X` should be the last move.   
2. If `O` wins, the number of `X` should be the same as the number of `O`, since `O` should be the last move.

Hence, any condition does not lie in the above possibilities are `false`.  

Note that in order to check if a player has won or not, we need to check all the three rows, columns, as well as the two diagnoals. 

## Time complexity

`O(n)`where `n` is the number of cells in the board, here the board is of size `3*3`, so it is actually `O(1)` time.  

## Space complexity

`O(1)`

```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean validTicTacToe(String[] board) {
        int countX = 0;
        int countO = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                if (board[i].charAt(j) == 'X') countX++;
                else if (board[i].charAt(j) == 'O') countO++;
            }
        }
        
        if (countO != countX && countO != countX - 1) return false;
        if (win(board, 'X') && countX - 1 != countO) return false;
        if (win(board, 'O') && countX != countO) return false;
        
        return true;
    }
    
    public boolean win(String[] b, char c) {
        int[] diagCount = new int[2];
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            if (b[i].charAt(0) == c && b[i].charAt(1) == c && b[i].charAt(2) == c) return true;
            if (b[0].charAt(i) == c && b[1].charAt(i) == c && b[2].charAt(i) == c) return true;
            if (b[i].charAt(i) == c) diagCount[0]++;
            if (b[i].charAt(2 - i) == c) diagCount[1]++;
        }
        
        return diagCount[0] == 3 || diagCount[1] == 3;
    }
}
```
