# Solution1: Two-pointers

The most important precondition in this question is the input array is sorted. Hence, Given 2 pointers within the array, named `start` and `end`, we can use the following algorithm to determine the two indexes of the numbers added up to `target`.  
1. If `numbers[start]+numbers[end] == target`, then `start` and `end` is the two indexes we are looking for.  
2. If `numbers[start]+numbers[end] < target`, then we know we are looking for a greater sum then the current one. Considering the input array is sorted, we need to move `start` to the right by one position to get the next bigger sum within the array.  
3. Similar to condition 2, if `numbers[start]+numbers[end] > target`, we move the `end` to the left by one position to get the next smaller sum within the array.  

## Time complexity

`O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input array, since we only iterate through the input array once at most. 

## Space complexity

`O(1)`

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
        // for invalid inputs, return 
        if (numbers == null || numbers.length == 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid input array");
        }
        
        int start = 0, end = numbers.length - 1;
        while (start < end) {
            if (numbers[start] + numbers[end] == target) {
                 return new int[]{start + 1, end + 1};
            } else if (numbers[start] + numbers[end] < target) {
                start++;
            } else { // numbers[start] + numbers[end] > target
                end--;
            }
        }
        
        // no result exists
        return new int[]{-1 , -1};
    }
}
```

# Solution2: Binary Search

Alternatively, we can use binary search to address the question. Given each number `i` from the input `numbers`, we should look for the existence of the number `target-i` to make a 2-sum whose result is `target`. Since the array is already sorted, binary sort is trivial. 

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
            int residual = target - numbers[i];
            int idx = binarySearch(numbers, residual, i);
            
            if (idx != -1) {
                return new int[]{i + 1, idx + 1};
            }
        }
        
        return new int[]{-1, -1};
    }
    
    /**
     * Search for a number target within a sorted array numbers
     */
    private int binarySearch(int[] numbers, int target, int currIdx) {
        int start = currIdx + 1, end = numbers.length - 1;
        
        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (numbers[mid] == target) {
                return mid;
            } else if (numbers[mid] < target) {
                start = mid + 1;
            } else {
                end = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}
```

## Time complexity

`O(nlogn)` where `n` is the length of the input array `numbers`, since for each number in `numbers`, we spent `O(logn)` time in looking for `target-i`. 

## Space complexity

`O(1)`.

# Solution3: Binary search against 2-sum

Rather than performing binary search for the residual, i.e. `target-numbers[i]`, we can perform binary search against the 2-sum result of the 2 pointers. Given 2 pointers `start` and `end`, since the array is sorted, we know that `numbers[start]+numbers[mid] < numbers[start]+numbers[end] < numbers[mid]+numbers[end]`. Hence we have the following conditions:  

1. If `numbers[start]+numbers[end] > target`, then we need to move `end` towards left.  
    - If `numbers[start]+numbers[mid] > target`, then the number we are looking for would be in `[start:mid-1]`.  
    - Else the number we are looking for would be in `[start:end-1]`.  
2. If `numbers[start]+numbers[end] < target`, then we need to move `start` towards right.  
    - If `numbers[mid]+numbers[end] < target`, then the number we are looking for would be in `[mid+1:end]`.  
    - Else the number we are looking for would be in `[start+1:end]`.  

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = numbers.length - 1;
        
        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = (start + end) / 2;
            
            if (numbers[start] + numbers[end] == target) {
                return new int[]{start + 1, end + 1};
            }
            
            if (numbers[start] + numbers[end] > target) {
                end = (numbers[start] + numbers[mid]) > target ? mid - 1 : end - 1;
            } else { // numbers[start] + numbers[end] < target
                start = (numbers[mid] + numbers[end]) < target ? mid + 1 : start + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return new int[]{-1, -1};
    }
}
```

## Time complexity

In the worst case when the 2 numbers we are looking for is at the center of the array, the run time would be `O(n)`. Otherwise the algorithm would run in less than linear time.  

## Space complexity

`O(1)`.
