# Solution1: ArrayList + HashMap

If we think of different functions of the system separately, we could easily come up with solutions. For `O(1)` insertion, something as simple as an ArrayList would be enough, but ArrayList has trouble when removing a specific value. For `O(1)` insertion and removal, HashMap or HashSet gets the work done, but it is hard to get a random element given we want to get all element randomly with equal possibility. So we just combine the two data structure. 

While we use an ArrayList to store all elements, we also use the HashMap to keep track of the index of every element. This way we have mitigate the side effects of slow removal within an ArrayList. However, even we know the index of the element that is going to be removed, if it is in the middle of the array, we still need to move every element after it. So we use a small trick here -- that is, we swap the current element which will be removed with the last element in the array, then we simply delete the last position of the array. In this way, we get both `O(1)` insertion and removal. 

For the `O(1)` random, we just use the random generator to generate a random int within the range of `[0, array.size() - 1]` and return the element on that index.  

## Time complexity  
`O(1)` for all operation.  

## Space complexity
`O(n)` where `n` is the number of values being stored. 

```java
class RandomizedSet {
    
    Map<Integer, Integer> locations;
    List<Integer> arr;
    java.util.Random rand;

    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public RandomizedSet() {
        this.locations = new HashMap<>();
        this.arr = new ArrayList<>();
        this.rand = new java.util.Random();
    }
    
    /** Inserts a value to the set. Returns true if the set did not already contain the specified element. */
    public boolean insert(int val) {
        if (locations.containsKey(val)) return false;
        arr.add(val);
        locations.put(val, arr.size() - 1);
        return true;
    }
    
    /** Removes a value from the set. Returns true if the set contained the specified element. */
    public boolean remove(int val) {
        if (!locations.containsKey(val)) return false;
        int loc = locations.get(val);
        arr.set(loc, arr.get(arr.size() - 1));
        locations.put(arr.get(arr.size() - 1), loc);
        locations.remove(val);
        arr.remove(arr.size() - 1);
        return true;
    }
    
    /** Get a random element from the set. */
    public int getRandom() {
        return arr.get(rand.nextInt(arr.size()));
    }
}

/**
 * Your RandomizedSet object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * RandomizedSet obj = new RandomizedSet();
 * boolean param_1 = obj.insert(val);
 * boolean param_2 = obj.remove(val);
 * int param_3 = obj.getRandom();
 */
