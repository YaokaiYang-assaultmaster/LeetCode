# Solution1: Straightforward solution

Follow the instructions of the question. We simply sort the array using a normal sorting algorithm, such as quick sort. And then we find out the maximum gap between any two consecutive element in the sorted array. 

## Time complexity

`O(nlogn + n) = (n)` where `n` is the length of the input array

## Space complexity

`O(1)`

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumGap(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length < 2) return 0;
        
        quickSort(nums, 0, nums.length - 1);
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int currGap = nums[i] - nums[i - 1];
            if (currGap > max) max = currGap;
        }
        
        return max;
    }
    
    private void quickSort(int[] nums, int start, int end) {
        if (start >= end) return;
        
        int pivot = nums[end];
        int pivotIndex = partition(nums, start, end, pivot);
        quickSort(nums, start, pivotIndex - 1);
        quickSort(nums, pivotIndex + 1, end);
    }
    
    private int partition(int[] nums, int start, int end, int pivot) {
        int p1 = start, p2 = end;
        while (true) {
            while (p1 < p2 && nums[p1] < pivot) p1++;
            while (p1 < p2 && nums[p2] > pivot) p2--;
            
            if (p1 >= p2) {
                break;
            } else {
                swap(nums, p1, p2);
            }
        }
        
        swap(nums, p1, end);
        return p1;
    }
    
    private void swap(int[] nums, int p1, int p2) {
        int tmp = nums[p1];
        nums[p1] = nums[p2];
        nums[p2] = tmp;
    }
}
```

# Solution2: Radix sort

Similar to the straight forward solution. Considering we are sorting 32 bit integers that have at most 10 digits, we could make use of some linear time sorting algorithms to optimize the time complexity. Radix sort is suitable for such a use case. 
Hence we could first sort the input using Radix sort and then check the gap between adjacent numbers. 

## Time complexity

`O(n*10 + n) = O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input array

## Space complexity

`O(n)`

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumGap(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length <= 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int max = Arrays.stream(nums).max().getAsInt();
        nums = lsdRadixSort(nums, 10, 1, max);
        
        max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int gap = nums[i] - nums[i - 1];
            max = gap > max ? gap : max;
        }
        
        return max;
    }
    
    private int[] lsdRadixSort(int[] nums, int radix, int exp, int max) {
        int[] aux = new int[nums.length];
        while (max / exp > 0) {
            int[] count = new int[radix]; // counting sort for each radix
            // get counts of each digit
            for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
                count[(nums[i] / exp) % radix]++;
            }
            
            // cumulative sum for each count
            for (int i = 1; i < count.length; i++) {
                count[i] += count[i - 1];
            }
            
            // counting sort
            for (int i = nums.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
                int idx = --count[(nums[i] / exp) % radix];
                aux[idx] = nums[i];
            }
            
            // copy back the sorted array
            for (int i= 0; i < aux.length; i++) {
                nums[i] = aux[i];
            }
            exp *= 10;
        }
        
        return nums;
    }
} 
```

# Solution3: Bucket sort

Considering we are sorting an array whose elements are integers within a given range, bucket sort is suitable for the case as well. A straightforward way of utilizing bucket sort is to sort the whole array based on bucket sort, with each bucket of size `1` and a total number of `max - min` buckets, in which `max` and `min` is the maximum and minimum number in the input array. 

However, since we do not realy care about the numbers themselves in the array, hence sorting the whole array introduces some redundant works. 

Let's go back to the gap between two consecutive numbers. Suppose that we have an array within which there are `n` numbers. Then the minimum maximum gap between adjacent elements can be get if and only if the array is sorted and have a uniform gap between each pair of the adjacent elements. And the minimum maximum gap should be `minMax = (max-min)/(n-1)`. This argument could be safely proved using proof by contradiction. Suppose we start with a sorted array with uniform gaps between all adjacent elements. And we move change one of the element to make it either greater or smaller. Let's take the former one as an example. In this case, the gap between this element and its successor will decrease, while the gap between this element and its predecessor will increase, leading to a bigger maximum gap we can get. 

Hence, we can safely divide the total array into `x` buckets, each of number range `bucketSize = floor((max-min)/(n-1)`, since the gap between numbers with in each buckets in this case would always be smaller than `minMax`, which is the minimum gap we can get ever, we could deduce that the maximum gap we can get in this case will definitely lies between successive buckets. With the size of the bucket in minc, we can get the total number of buckets we need: `x = (max-min)/bucketSize`.

After we got all the buckets, we can simply iterate through the buckets and find out the maximum gap between the buckets. In order to get the gap between the buckets, we can keep track of the maximum and minimum value stored within each buckets, and the gap would be `currMin - prevMax`. 

Based on the above analysis, we can conclude with the following algorithm.  
1. Select bucket size of `bucketSize = (max-min)/(nums.length-1)-1`, and bucket number of `(max-min)/bucketSize+1` correspondingly.  
2. Iterate through all the numbers in the `nums` array and put it in the bucket with index `idx = nums[i]/bucketSize`, whose range is `[min + idx * bucketSize, min + (idx + 1) * bucketSize)`. For each bucket, we do not really putting numbers in it, but rather we keep the maximum and minimum we have stored in this range, which is related to the inter-bucket gaps. __In this way we have reduced the number of comparison we need.__
3. Iterate through each bucket and calculate the inter-bucket gaps based on bucket-maximum and bucket-minimum values. 

## Time complexity

`O(n + b) = O(n)`, in which `n` and `b` is the length of the input array and the number of buckets respectively. In the worst case where the bucket size is 1, `b==n`. 

## Space complexity

`O(b)`, `b` is the number of buckets. 

```java
class Solution {
    class Bucket {
        boolean used = false;
        int rangeMax = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int rangeMin = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    }
    public int maximumGap(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length < 2) return 0;
        
        int max = Arrays.stream(nums).max().getAsInt();
        int min = Arrays.stream(nums).min().getAsInt();
        int bucketSize = Math.max(1, (max - min) / nums.length - 1);
        int bucketCount = max / bucketSize + 1;
        Bucket[] buckets = new Bucket[bucketCount];
        for (int i = 0; i < buckets.length; i++) {
            buckets[i] = new Bucket();
        }
        for (int ele : nums) {
            int idx = ele / bucketSize;
            buckets[idx].used = true;
            buckets[idx].rangeMax = Math.max(buckets[idx].rangeMax, ele);
            buckets[idx].rangeMin = Math.min(buckets[idx].rangeMin, ele);
        }
        
        int ret = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int prevMax = min;
        for (int i = 0; i < buckets.length; i++) {
            if (!buckets[i].used) continue;
            ret = Math.max(buckets[i].rangeMin - prevMax, ret);
            prevMax = buckets[i].rangeMax;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
}
```
