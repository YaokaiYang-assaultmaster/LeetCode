# Solution1: Iterative BFS

Since we want the right view of the tree, aka the right most node value of each level, the BFS algorithm would be suitable for this condition. If we utilize the iterative BFS, and keeping track of the number of nodes on each level, then we would be able to know what is the last node at each level when we traverse from left to right, and this node would be the right view node. 

## Time complexity

`O(n)`, in which `n` is the number of nodes within the tree. 

## Space complexity

`O(n/2) = O(n)` in the worst case, which corresponds to the greatest number of nodes a level can have. In binary tree, the last level could contain at most `n/2` leaf nodes. 

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> rightSideView(TreeNode root) {
        List<Integer> ret = new ArrayList<>();
        if (root == null) return ret;
        
        Deque<TreeNode> deque = new ArrayDeque<>();
        deque.offer(root);
        while (!deque.isEmpty()) {
            int level = deque.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < level; i++) {
                TreeNode curr = deque.poll();
                if (i == level - 1) {
                    ret.add(curr.val);
                }
                if (curr.left != null) deque.offer(curr.left);
                if (curr.right != null) deque.offer(curr.right);
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
}
```

# Solution2: Right first recursive DFS

The idea is to traverse each level in a right first way. Since we only want the right most node of each level and we are traverse in a right first way, the first node we meet at each level is the node viewed from right side. 

## Time complexity

`O(n)`, `n` is the size of the tree. 

## Space complexity

`O(logn)` to `O(n)` space for the recursion stack.

```java
public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> rightSideView(TreeNode root) {
        List<Integer> ret = new ArrayList<>();
        
        rightSideView(root, ret, 0);
        return ret;
    }
    
    private void rightSideView(TreeNode curr, List<Integer> ret, int depth) {
        if (curr == null) return;
        
        if (ret.size() == depth) {
            ret.add(curr.val);
        }
        
        rightSideView(curr.right, ret, depth + 1);
        rightSideView(curr.left, ret, depth + 1);
    }
}
```
