# Solution1: Brute force

The amount of water that can be hold within a single cell is decided by the minimum of maximum height for the cells located on both its left and right side. Hence, we could start from every position within the `height` array, and then we expand to its lefthand side and righthand side to look for the maximum height on both side. Then the amount of water that can be hold within the current position is `Math.min(maxLeft, maxRight) - currHeight`.  

With this simple idea, we have the following algorithm.

## Time complexity

`O(n^2)` where `n` is the length of the input array. Since for every position, we have to check `n` positions. 

## Space complexity

`O(1)`

```java
class Solution {
    public int trap(int[] height) {
        int ret = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < height.length; i++) {
            int maxLeft = 0;
            int maxRight = 0;
            for (int j = i; j >= 0; j--) {
                maxLeft = Math.max(maxLeft, height[j]);
            }
            for (int j = i; j < height.length; j++) {
                maxRight = Math.max(maxRight, height[j]);
            }
            
            ret += Math.min(maxLeft, maxRight) - height[i];
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
}
```

# Solution2: Stacks

```java
class Solution {
    public int trap(int[] height) {
        if (height == null || height.length == 0) return 0;
        Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        int curr = 0;
        int ret = 0;
        while (curr < height.length) {
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && height[stack.peek()] < height[curr]) {
                int top = stack.pop();
                if (stack.isEmpty()) break;
                int dist = curr - stack.peek() - 1;
                int h = Math.min(height[curr], height[stack.peek()]) - height[top];
                ret += h * dist;
            }
            
            stack.push(curr);
            curr++;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
}
```


# Solution3: Two pointers

We want to know the maximum amount of water that can be trapped. 
It is obvious that the 2 boundary, which is height[0] and height[height.length - 1] respectively, cannot hold any water.

So we may consider start from 2 boundary of the array and traverse inside the height array. 
Based on the bucket theory, we need to always consider from the side with a lower height. 
The algorithm is as following:  
1. Start from the 2 boundary of the height array and keep 2 pointers for left and right point.  
2. Keep 2 int value leftH and rightH to store the previous height we encountered at 2 sides.   
3. Move the pointer with lower height since this is the upper bound of the bucket. There are 2 conditions:  
    1.  the height next to current boarder has a greater height value, then we cannot increase the total water. Then we just update the corresponding height of left or right boarder.   
    2. the height next to current boarder has a smaller height value, then we can at least hold the water amount of `leftH/rightH - height[currBoarder]` (remember we are always moving from the boarder with smaller height value).  
4. Continue until left pointer and right pointer meets. 

## Time complexity

`O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input array.

## Space complexity

`O(1)`

```java
public class Solution {
    public int trap(int[] height) {
        if (height == null || height.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.length - 1;
        int leftH = height[left];
        int rightH = height[right];
        
        int ret = 0;
        while (left < right) {
            if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                left++;
                ret += Math.max(0, leftH - height[left]);
                leftH = Math.max(height[left], leftH);
            } else {
                right--;
                ret += Math.max(0, rightH - height[right]);
                rightH = Math.max(height[right], rightH);
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
}
```

# Solution4: Dynamic programming

In solution1, we did some redundant work by checking the maximum height on left hand side and right hand side. Actually we can cache the maximum height up to a position `i` from left to right and from right to left into two separate arrays and then perform the cauculation for each position. Here comes the dynamic programming. 

## Time complexity

`O(n)`

## Space complexity

`O(1)`

```java
class Solution {
    public int trap(int[] height) {
        if (height == null || height.length == 0) return 0;
        
        // stores maximum heights up to i from left to right
        int[] leftHeights = new int[height.length];
        // stores maximum heights up to i from right to left
        int[] rightHeights = new int[height.length];
        
        leftHeights[0] = height[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < height.length; i++) {
            leftHeights[i] = Math.max(leftHeights[i - 1], height[i]);
        }
        rightHeights[height.length - 1] = height[height.length - 1];
        for (int i = height.length - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            rightHeights[i] = Math.max(rightHeights[i + 1], height[i]);
        }
        
        int ret = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < height.length - 1; i++) {
            ret += Math.min(leftHeights[i], rightHeights[i]) - height[i];
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
}
```
