# Solution1: Brute force

The brute force solution for solving this quesstion is pretty obvious. We just need to follow exactly what the question asks: __check each pair of the number in `time` with a nested loop and find all the sums that are divisible by 60__. 

```java
class Solution {
    public int numPairsDivisibleBy60(int[] time) {
        if (time == null || time.length == 0) return 0;
        
        int ret = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < time.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < time.length; j++) {
                if ((time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0) {
                    ret += 1;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
}
```

## Time complexity

`O(n^2)` where `n` is the length of the input array `time`. 

## Space complexity

`O(1)`. 

# Solution2: 2-sum style check

Checking all the possible pairs from `time` and examine if they are divisible by `60` is ineivitable `O(n^2)` time since there are `O(n^2)` possible combinations. In orde to optimize this solution, we need to think reversely. Given a number `a`, if we can find whether a number `b` exists in times such that `a+b` satisfies the condition `(a+b)%60=0` efficiently, say, in `O(1)` time, then we can make the algorithm `O(n)`, which is a algorithm similar to how we would address a 2-sum like question. 

So how do we do that? Well in order to find the existence of a number, we would need `O(n)` extra space for a HashMap. Since number that is a integer multiple of `60` is the sum we are looking for in this case, we also need to find out how to get the `b` given a number `a`, since `b=60*x-a` where `x` is the factor we don't know. How to find out `x`?

Since we know all the numbers in `time`, the biggest possible sum of any 2 number combination from the `time` array is clear, which is `2*y` where `y` is the biggest number in `time`. Hence the factor `x` can be calculated by `2*y/60+1`. E.g. for input array `[30, 140, 100, 30]`, the biggest integer multiple of `60` we can ever get is `140*2=280`. Hence the biggest multiplication factor `x` would be `280/60+1=5`. Thus the sums we need to check for any 2 number combination would be `60, 120, 180, 240, 300`, so it essentially turns into a question similar as 2 sum while there are multiple sums to check. 

Note that since we are looking for the total number of possible combinations, we also need to take into consideration where the same number appeared for more than once. E.g. for input `[30, 30, 150]`, when we check `150` and sum `180`, the resulted pair count should be 2, since there are two `(150, 30)` combination. We also need to address the case when the same number are used for the combination.

The final algorithm is as following. 

1. Pre-compile a HashMap in which the key is the numbers from `time` and the value is the occurrence of each number.   
2. Get the max number from the input and compute the highest multiplication factor `x` of `60` as described above.   
3. For all the possible integer multiple of `60`, i.e. from `60` to `60*x`, do following steps.  
4. For each number `time[i]` in `time`, check whether `60*j-time[i]` exists in the hashmap where `1<=j<=x`.  
5. If `60*j-time[i]` exists, go to step 6 if `time[i]==60*j-time[i]`, otherwise go to step 7.  
6. Add `map.get(60*j-time[i])-1` to the resulted count since we need to minus the occurrence of `time[i]`.  
7. Add `map.get(60*j-time[i])` to the resulted count.  
8. Divide the count by 2 and return. Since we are visiting each pair twice. E.g. For input `[30, 150]`, when check `30`, we would add `1` to cound and when check `150` we add another 1 to the result.  

```java
class Solution {
    public int numPairsDivisibleBy60(int[] time) {
        if (time == null || time.length == 0) return 0;
        
        Map<Integer, Integer> existed = new HashMap<>(); // (number, #occcurrence)
        int max = 0;
        for (int ele : time) {
            existed.put(ele, existed.getOrDefault(ele, 0) + 1);
            max = ele > max ? ele : max;
        }
        
        int times = max * 2 / 6 + 1;
        
        int ret = 0;
        for (int ele : time) {
            ret += countPairForNum(ele, times, existed);
        }
        
        return ret / 2; // we are visiting each pair twice so divide the final count by 2
    }
    
    private int countPairForNum(int num, int times, Map<Integer, Integer> existed) {
        int ret = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= times; i++) {
            int sum = 60 * i;
            int occurrence = existed.getOrDefault(sum - num, 0);
            if (num == sum - num) { // if it is the same number constructing the sum, we need to minus 1 from the occurrence to remove self. 
                ret = occurrence > 1 ? ret + occurrence - 1 : ret;
            } else {
                ret += occurrence;
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
}
```

## Time complexity

`O(2*n*c)=O(n)` where `n=time.length` and `c` is the max multiplication factor of `60` which is a constant. 

## Space complexity

`O(n)` for the hashmap.  

# Solution3: 2-sum style check with simplification on modulo condition

Given that modulo operation possesses distributive feature: `(a + b) mod n = [(a mod n) + (b mod n)] mod n`, we can further simplify the check. 

Basically, in order to find all combninations from input `time` which satisfies `(a+b)%60=0`, which equals to `(a%60+b%60)%60=0`, we would need to find 2 numbers from `time` such that they satisfy one of the following condition:  
1. `a%60=0 && b%60=0`  
2. `a%60+b%60=0`

Hence we have the following solution:  

```java
class Solution {
    public int numPairsDivisibleBy60(int[] time) {
        if (time == null || time.length == 0) return 0;
        
        int[] residual = new int[60];
        int ret = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < time.length; i++) {
            int curr = time[i] % 60;
            if (curr == 0) {
                ret += residual[0];
            } else {
                ret += residual[60 - curr];
            }
            residual[curr]++;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
}
```

## Time complexity

`O(n)`

## Space complexity

`O(60)=O(1)`
