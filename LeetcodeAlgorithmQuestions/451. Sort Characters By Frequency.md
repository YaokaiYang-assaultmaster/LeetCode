# Solution1: HashMap + MaxHeap

Given we want to sort the characters in the string based on frequency, max heap is apparently a suitable data structure to be used here since a max heap can always give us the max value on the top of it. In order to use a max heap, we would need to put the character and their count together and ask max heap to sort based on the count via custom comparator implementation. So the algorithm should be something as following:   
1. Create a wrapper class `Tuple` to wrap the letter together with its count.   
2. Iterate through the input String and aggregate the frequency of each character using a HashMap.  
3. Iterate through the HashMap to put all the `{letter, count}` tuple into the max heap.   
4. Take the top element from the tuple and put the letters into a String until the max heap is empty.  

```java
class Solution {
    class Tuple {
        int count;
        char letter;
        
        Tuple(int count, char letter) {
            this.count = count;
            this.letter = letter;
        }
    }
    public String frequencySort(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.length() == 0) return "";
        
        PriorityQueue<Tuple> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> {
            return -1 * Integer.compare(a.count, b.count);
        });
        Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        char[] charArr = s.toCharArray();
        
        for (char c : charArr) {
            map.put(c, map.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        for (char c : map.keySet()) {
            maxHeap.add(new Tuple(map.get(c), c));
        }
        
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        while (!maxHeap.isEmpty()) {
            Tuple curr = maxHeap.poll();
            for (int i = 0; i < curr.count; i++) {
                sb.append(curr.letter);
            }
        }
        
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

## Time complexity

Assume the length of the input String is `n`, we need `O(n)` time to construct the frequency hashmap, then we need `O(nlogn)` time to construct the max heap and `O(nlogn)` time to take out all the elements from the max heap in the worst case, at last we need `O(n)` time to build the resulted String (as the number of distinct characters are limited, we can argue it's `O(n)` time as well as it is related to the input string length). So the time complexity is `O(n+nlogn+nlogn)=O(nlogn)`.  

## Space complexity

We need `O(n)` for the HashMap and `O(n)` space for the max heap, so `O(n)` in total.
