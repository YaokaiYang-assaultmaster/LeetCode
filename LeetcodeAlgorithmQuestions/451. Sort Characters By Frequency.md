# Solution1: HashMap + MaxHeap

Given we want to sort the characters in the string based on frequency, max heap is apparently a suitable data structure to be used here since a max heap can always give us the max value on the top of it. In order to use a max heap, we would need to put the character and their count together and ask max heap to sort based on the count via custom comparator implementation. So the algorithm should be something as following:   
1. Create a wrapper class `Tuple` to wrap the letter together with its count.   
2. Iterate through the input String and aggregate the frequency of each character using a HashMap.  
3. Iterate through the HashMap to put all the `{letter, count}` tuple into the max heap.   
4. Take the top element from the tuple and put the letters into a String until the max heap is empty.  

Note we need to use StringBuilder when building the resulted String here, since String is immutable. Using simple String concatenation (i.e. str1 + str2) will result in `O(n^2)` building time for a String with length `n`.  

```java
class Solution {
    class Tuple {
        int count;
        char letter;
        
        Tuple(int count, char letter) {
            this.count = count;
            this.letter = letter;
        }
    }
    public String frequencySort(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.length() == 0) return "";
        
        PriorityQueue<Tuple> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> {
            return -1 * Integer.compare(a.count, b.count);
        });
        Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        char[] charArr = s.toCharArray();
        
        for (char c : charArr) {
            map.put(c, map.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        for (char c : map.keySet()) {
            maxHeap.add(new Tuple(map.get(c), c));
        }
        
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        while (!maxHeap.isEmpty()) {
            Tuple curr = maxHeap.poll();
            for (int i = 0; i < curr.count; i++) {
                sb.append(curr.letter);
            }
        }
        
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

## Time complexity

Assume the length of the input String is `n`, we need `O(n)` time to construct the frequency hashmap, then we need `O(nlogn)` time to construct the max heap and `O(nlogn)` time to take out all the elements from the max heap in the worst case, at last we need `O(n)` time to build the resulted String (as the number of distinct characters are limited, we can argue it's `O(n)` time as well as it is related to the input string length). So the time complexity is `O(n+nlogn+nlogn)=O(nlogn)`.  

## Space complexity

We need `O(n)` for the HashMap and `O(n)` space for the max heap, so `O(n)` in total. 

# Solution2: Sorting and sorting

The solution of this question can also be found through 2 key steps. Firstly, find the all the char sequence that are constructed using the same character, which can be easily achieved by sorting the input String alphabetically. Secondly, sorting all the char sequence based on their length in reverse order (i.e. longer ones come first), which can achieved using a custom comparator. Finally, we just need to combine the resulted String list sequentially to get the result. 

```java
class Solution {
    public String frequencySort(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.length() == 0) return "";
        
        char[] arr = s.toCharArray();
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        
        List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        sb.append(arr[0]);
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] != arr[i - 1]) {
                list.add(sb.toString());
                sb = new StringBuilder();
            }
            sb.append(arr[i]);
        }
        list.add(sb.toString());
        
        Collections.sort(list, (a, b) -> {
            return (b.length() - a.length());
        });
        
        sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (String ele : list) {
            sb.append(ele);
        }
        
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

## Time complexity

`O(nlogn + nlogn + n) = O(nlogn)`. Since there are 2 sorting in the code and 1 StringBuilder building. 

## Space complexity

`O(n)` for the ArrayList used to store intermediate result.
