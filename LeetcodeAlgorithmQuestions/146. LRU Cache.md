# Solution1: HashMap with LinkedList stored keys (Time Limit Exceeded)

First of all, we need to clarify what do we need to store for a LRU cache. In this question, we need to store: 
1. The key and values. This is the most important part.  
2. A LinkedList keeping the time sequence information of the keys, in which the least recently used key are stored at the beginning of the list. Since we need to constantly remove/addFirst/removeLast on the keys stored in the list based on their operation and make sure that the least recently used keys are always at the beginning of the list, a LinkedList would be suitable due to its `O(1)` operation for remove and add. (But in this case we do need `O(n)` time to look for the key in the list).  

With the two storage in mind, the implementation should be straightforward.

For `get` operation, the procedure should be:  
1. If the HashMap does not contains the given key, we simply return `-1`.  
2. Otherwise, the we should move the key to the beginning of LinkedList and return the `value` corresponding `key`, which is stored in the HashMap.  

For `put` operation, the process should be:  
1. If the HashMap does not contain the key and the size of the HashMap reaches the capacity limit, we need to remove the oldest key and value from both the LinkedList and HashMap. The oldest key lies at the end of the LinkedList.  
2. Otherwise, there are two conditions. One is that the cache size has not yet reached the capacity limit, the other is that the cache size reached the limit but the key already exists. They follow the same operation, though. We first remove the `key` from the linked list, put it at the head of the LinkedList, and then update the `value` of the `key`.  

## Time complexity  

`get`: `O(n)`. Since we need to iterate through the LinkedList and looking for the key, in which `n` is the maximum size of the cache.  
`put`: `O(n)`.   

## Space complexity  

`O(n)`

```java
class LRUCache {
    private Map<Integer, Integer> cache;
    private LinkedList<Integer> recent;
    private int cap;

    public LRUCache(int capacity) {
        this.cache = new HashMap<>();
        this.recent = new LinkedList<>();
        this.cap = capacity;
    }
    
    public int get(int key) {
        if (!this.cache.containsKey(key)) {
            return -1; 
        }
        removeFromRecent(key);
        this.recent.addFirst(key);
        return this.cache.get(key);
    }
    
    public void put(int key, int value) {
        if (!this.cache.containsKey(key) && this.cache.size() >= this.cap) {
            int last = this.recent.getLast();
            this.recent.removeLast();
            this.cache.remove(last);
        } else {
            removeFromRecent(key);
        }
        this.recent.addFirst(key);
        this.cache.put(key, value);
    }
    
    private void removeFromRecent(int key) {
        for (int i = 0; i < this.recent.size(); i++) {
            if (this.recent.get(i) == key) {
                this.recent.remove(i);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

# Solution2: Optimized HashMap and LinkedList keys

In the above solution, our `O(n)` `get` and `put`operation leades to TLE. The bottleneck of the whole system is the `removeFromRecent` function. Hence as long as we can figure out a way to make the function `O(1)` time, both `get` and `put` will be `O(1)`.  

In order to improve the operation to `O(1)`, we need to keep another map storing the `key-LinkedListNode` relationship hence anytime we want to remove a key, we immediately know where the node is in `O(1)` time. This requires us to keep a `Double LinkedList` since we need to link the previous and next Node of a given node. Also we need to always keep the pointer to the head and tail of the List.  

## Time complexity

`get`: `O(1)`   
`put`: `O(1)`  

## Space complexity

`O(n)` where `n` is the maximum capacity of the cache.

            curr.value = value;
            cache.put(key, curr);
            addNode(curr);
            
            count++;
            
            if (count > capacity) {
                DLinkedNode tail = popTail();
                cache.remove(tail.key);
                count--;
            }
        } else {
            curr.value = value;
            moveToHead(curr);
        }
    }

        node.next = recent;

     */
    private DLinkedNode popTail() {
