# Solution1: Two-pass HashMap

A naive approach to this problem is: for each number in the array, check if the any of the remaining numbers equal to `target - nums[i]`. This is `O(n^2)` time.

However, we could do better by remembering the number and their index information with a HashMap. Hence after we initialized the indexing information, we could use `O(1)` time to check for the existance of `target - nums[i]` in the input array.

Note that we do not need to worry about duplicates in the input array. Since as long as there is __at least__ one number in the array that is equal to `target - nums[i]` which is not `nums[i]` itself, the requirement is satisfied. 

## Time complexity

`O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input array. 

## Space complexity

`O(n)`

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid Input");
        }
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (map.containsKey(target - nums[i]) && map.get(target - nums[i]) != i) {
                return new int[]{map.get(target - nums[i]), i};
            }
        }
        
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid Argument");
    }
}
```
