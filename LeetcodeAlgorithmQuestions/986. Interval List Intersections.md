# Solution1: Two pointers

Considering the two sets of sorted intervals we have, we are actually doing a __Merge__ state of the merge sort algorithm. In this case we just use two points to loop through the intervals within `A` and `B` respectively. The possible conditions are:

1. Current interval of `A` and `B` does not have any overlap, i.e. `currA.end < currB.start` or `currB.end < currA.start`.   
2. Were there be a overlapped interval, the overlapped area should be the greater start point and the smaller end point out of the two.  
3. Increase the pointer of the one with a smaller end point out of the two to look for next possible overlap. 

## Time complexity

`O(m+n)` where `m` and `n` is the length of `A` and `B` respectively.

## Space complexity

If we do not take into consideration of the memory used for storing results, the space is `O(1)`. If considerinng the memory for storing output, it's O`(k)` where `k` is proportional to the number of overlapped intervals. 

## Take Away

When using `ArrayList.toArray()` method, using the form `ArrayList.toArray(T[0])`, which means the size is decided dynamically when allocating the storage for the new array, as discussed [here](https://shipilev.net/blog/2016/arrays-wisdom-ancients/#_conclusion), this is safter and faster. 

```Java
/**
 * Definition for an interval.
 * public class Interval {
 *     int start;
 *     int end;
 *     Interval() { start = 0; end = 0; }
 *     Interval(int s, int e) { start = s; end = e; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public Interval[] intervalIntersection(Interval[] A, Interval[] B) {
        int indexA = 0, indexB = 0;
        List<Interval> res = new ArrayList<>();
        while (indexA < A.length && indexB < B.length) {
            if (A[indexA].end < B[indexB].start) {
                indexA++;
            } else if (A[indexA].start > B[indexB].end) {
                indexB++;
            } else {
                int currStart = Math.max(A[indexA].start, B[indexB].start);
                int currEnd = Math.min(A[indexA].end, B[indexB].end);
                Interval curr = new Interval(currStart, currEnd);
                res.add(curr);
                if (A[indexA].end < B[indexB].end) {
                    indexA++;
                } else {
                    indexB++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return res.toArray(new Interval[0]);
    }
}
```
