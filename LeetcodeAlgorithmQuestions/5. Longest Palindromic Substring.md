# Solution1: Expand around center

In order to get the longest palindrome in the input string, we need to at least check each character once. Thus introduces a lower bound runtime of `O(n)`. And without using __Manacher's algorithm__, we need to do it in a normal way by checking each possible palindrome generated during this process. Then here comes the question: How can we check unique palindromes based on each character we are looking at in this step?

Palindrome has the nice feature of centering around its midpoint. We can use this feature to expand around the character we are looking at during iteration. Hence to make sure in each step we are actually checking different palindromes (avoiding redundant works). And also we need to pay attention that there are 2 kinds of palindromes: odd length one and even length one. For odd length one, the middle point is the character in the middle. But for even length one, the middle point is between the 2 center characters. 

And we just need to keep track of the longest palindrome we have got through this process.

Suppose the length of the input string is `n`.

Time complexity: `O(n^2)` since for each of the n characters, we need to spend `O(n)` time for checking the palindrome anchored at this position. 

Space complexity: `O(1)` since we are not using any extra space. 

```Java
class Solution {
    public String longestPalindrome(String s) {
        String longest = "";
        if (s == null || s.length() == 0) {
            return longest;
        }
        char[] chars = s.toCharArray();
        for (int i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {
            String tmp = getLongestPalindrome(chars, i);
            if (longest.length() < tmp.length()) {
                longest = tmp;
            }
        }
        
        return longest;
    }
    
    private String getLongestPalindrome(char[] chars, int anchor) {
        // check palindrome of odd length
        int i = 0;
        while(anchor - i >= 0 && anchor + i < chars.length && chars[anchor - i] == chars[anchor + i]) {
            i++;
        }
        i--;
        String odd = new String(chars, anchor - i, i* 2 + 1);
        
        // check palindrome of even length
        i = 0;
        while (anchor - i >= 0 && anchor + i + 1 < chars.length && chars[anchor - i] == chars[anchor + i + 1]) {
            i++;
        }
        i--;
        String even = i < 0 ? "" : new String(chars, anchor - i, (i + 1) * 2);
        
        return odd.length() > even.length() ? odd : even;
    }
}
```

# Solution2: Dynamic Programming

A brute-force algorithm of this question is to generate every possible substring of the input string and check if they are valid palindrome. However, in this process we did a lot of redundant work by check the same substring again and again. These works can be avoided by using __Dynamic Programming__. To uniquely identify a substring, we need 2 index: `start` and `end`. And for each substring with index `(i, j)`, we can decide if it is a valid palindrome by cheking `valid[i+1][j-1] && s[i] == s[j]`. The base cases are:

1. `valid[i][i] = true`
2. `valid[i][i+1] = s[i] == s[i+1]`

Suppose the input string has a length of `n`.

Time complexity: `O(n^2)` since we have to fill the 2D array.

Space complexity: `O(n^2)` since we store information in the 2D array.

```Java
class Solution {
    public String longestPalindrome(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.length() == 0) return "";
        String ret = "";
        int len = s.length() - 1;
        boolean[][] dp = new boolean[len + 1][len + 1];
        for (int i = len; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = i; j <= len; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j)) && (j - i <= 2 || dp[i + 1][j - 1]);
                if (dp[i][j] && (j - i + 1 > ret.length())) {
                    ret = s.substring(i, j + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
}
```
