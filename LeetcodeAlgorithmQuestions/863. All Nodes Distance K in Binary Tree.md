# Solution1: BFS with treating the tree as a graph

Considering that the TreeNode with given distance `K` to our `target` TreeNode could lies both up and down in the tree, and also the uni-directional nature of the Binary Tree, we should traverse the tree in a graph traversal style rather than a tree style. Hence we first need the mapping relationship between a child node to its parent ndoe. In this way we could gradually search from the target and spread out layer by layer tri-directionaly (here layer refers to the sphere of TreeNodes whose distance to the `target` is the same). By tri-directionaly, we mean we check the left child, right child and the parent of a given TreeNode, since they make up the sphere of TreeNodes that is of distance __1__ to a Node.  

Hence, the algorithm could be concluded as following:



```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> distanceK(TreeNode root, TreeNode target, int K) {
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        if (root == null || target == null) return res;
        
        Map<TreeNode, TreeNode> parents = new HashMap<>();
        Deque<TreeNode> bfsQueue = new ArrayDeque<>();
        bfsQueue.offer(root);
        parents.put(root, null);
        while (!bfsQueue.isEmpty()) {
            int levelCount = bfsQueue.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < levelCount; i++) {
                TreeNode curr = bfsQueue.poll();
                if (curr.left != null) {
                    bfsQueue.offer(curr.left);

        Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(null);
        queue.offer(target);
        seen.add(null);
        seen.add(target);
        int dist = 0;
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            TreeNode curr = queue.poll();
            if (curr == null) { // this is the split point of the different circles/distances
                if (dist == K) {
                    for (TreeNode n : queue) {
                        res.add(n.val);
                    }
                    break;
                }
                queue.add(null);
                dist++;
            } else {
                if (!seen.contains(curr.left)) {
