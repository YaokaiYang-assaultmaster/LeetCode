# Solution1: BFS with treating the tree as a graph

Considering that the TreeNode with given distance `K` to our `target` TreeNode could lies both up and down in the tree, and also the uni-directional nature of the Binary Tree, we should traverse the tree in a graph traversal style rather than a tree style. Hence we first need the mapping relationship between a child node to its parent ndoe. In this way we could gradually search from the target and spread out layer by layer tri-directionaly (here layer refers to the sphere of TreeNodes whose distance to the `target` is the same). By tri-directionaly, we mean we check the left child, right child and the parent of a given TreeNode, since they make up the sphere of TreeNodes that is of distance __1__ to a Node.  

Hence, the algorithm could be concluded as following:

1. BFS or DFS the Binary Tree to construct the mapping of each TreeNode to its parent.   
2. traverse the tree from the `target` in a graph BFS traversal style. During which we will find the sphere of TreeNodes that is of distance `K` to the `target`.   

## Time complexity

`O(2n) = O(n)` in which `n` is the number of TreeNodes in the tree. 

## Space complexity

`O(4n) = O(n)` in which `n` is the number of TreeNodes in the tree.

# Solution2: Recursive DFS with level-wise diatance calculation

In order to get the TreeNode that is of distance `K` to the given `target` Node, there are 3 conditions. 

1. The TreeNodes we are looking for are in the __subtree rooted at `target`__. In this case we can simply use bfs to looking for the children of `target` that is of distance `K`.  
2. Given any TreeNode `node` that is of a higher level in the tree than `target`, if `target` resides within its left subtree with a distance `d`, then the TreeNodes in its right subtree with a distance `K - d` are the TreeNodes we are looking for. And vice versa. An edge case of this is that `d == K`, in this case the current subtree root `node` is the TreeNode that satisfies the distance requirement.    
3. Given any TreeNode `node`, if `target` lies neither in its left subtree nor in its right subtree, then it will be searched by its higher level parents, which goes into the above two conditions.  

Hence we have the following implementation, within which we have a `subTreeAdd` function handles looking for the nodes that is of distance `dist` to the `node` within the subtree rooted at it. 

## Time complexity  

`O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.  

## Space complexity  

`O(logn)` for the recursion stack. `O(n)` for the space used for storing results in the worst case.
