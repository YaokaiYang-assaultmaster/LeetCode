# Solution1: Three-step solution

There are three parts contained in the solution of the current question. First one is the left boundary of the tree, second one is the bottom leaf nodes of the tree, and the third part is the right boundary of the tree which, according to the anti-clockwise requirement, should be stored from bottom to top in the result. And each of those sub-problems can be solved easily with a specific tree traversal strategy. Hence, we could solve the question in a 3-step strategy.  

As a first step, we iterate all the left boundary nodes of the tree, using the following algorithm.   
1. Start from the `root`, if current node have a left child, then we go to the left child and add its `val` to the `result`.  
2. If the current node does not have a left child but have a right child, then we go to the right child.  
3. If the current node does not have both children, then it is a leaf nodes so we stops the iteration.  

Secondly, we would like to add the leaf nodes to the `result` from left to right. Then just a simple left-first DFS would be good enough. 

Thirdly, we need to add the right boundary nodes to the  result from bottom to top. Hence we could make use of a stack to store the result using a similar algorithm as described for left boundary nodes, then add back the results, so the sequence will be reversed naturally.  

## Time complexity

`O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.  

## Space complexity  

`O(n)` in the worst case, `O(logn)` on average for the recursion stack.

        if (root == null) return ret;
        
        if (!isLeaf(root)) ret.add(root.val);
        TreeNode curr = root.left;
        // add left boundary
        while (curr != null) {
            if (!isLeaf(curr)) {

            return;
        }
        
        if (root.left != null) {
            dfsAddBottom(root.left, ret);
        }

        }

}

# Solution2: Pre-order traversal

We can actually do it within one traversal, if we could properly identify whether the current TreeNode is on left boundary, right boundary or a leaf node. If we use the pre-order traversal, then the traversal sequence is the same as the anti-clock wise boundary sequence we want, except for the right boundary, which need to be reversed. Then the problem remains as: how do we decide the identity of a given Node, i.e. if it is on the left boundary, right boundary, bottom boundary, or none of those. 

Given we using the following flags for indicating the current node's identity.  
```
Flag == 0 => current node is root.  
Flag == 1 => current ndoe is on left boundary
Flag == 2 => current node on right boundary
Flag == 3 => current node is an internal node
```

The algorithm could be divided as 3 parts.  

Firstly, decide if the current node is a leaf node. This is easy, we simply check if both the left child and right node is `null`.  

Then we want to determine the identity of the left child of a node.  
1. If the current node is `root`, then its left node, if exists, is on left boundary.  
2. If the current node is on left boundary, then its left node, if exists, is on left boundary.  
3. if the current node is on right boundary and its right node is `null`, then its left node is on right boundary.  

Furthermore, we want to decide the identity of the right child of a node.  
1. If the current node is `root`, then its right node, if exists, is on right boundary.  
2. If the current node is on right boundary, then its right node, if exists, is on right boundary.  
3. If the current node is on left boundary and its left node is `null`, then its right node is on left boundary.  

Based on the flags of the nodes, we just need to perform a normal pre-order traversal and then put nodes of each category into separate lists and then combine them together. Note that for right boundary, since we need to reverse the order, we always put them at the beginning of the ArrayList. 

## Time complexity

`O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.  

## Space complexity

`O(n)` in the worst case when the every node in the tree only have 1 child. `O(logn)` on average.
