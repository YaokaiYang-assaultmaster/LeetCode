# Soluion1: Next Permutation Algorithm

Next permutation algorithm has existed since 14th centery. Based on this classic and simple algorithm, this question can be solved in following steps.   

1. Start from the end of the array and find the first number that is less then its next element in the array, i.e. `nums[first] < nums[first + 1]`. If no such number exists, which means that the array is sorted in descending order, we re-sort it in the ascending order and return.
2. Start from the end of the array and find a `nums[p]` such that `nums[p]` is greater than `nums[first]` we have found.
3. Swap `nums[p]` with `nums[first]`.
4. Reverse the numbers from and including `nums[first + 1]` up to and including `nums[nums.length - 1]` into ascending order.

## Time complexity

`O(n)` where `n` is the length of the array. 

## Space complexity

`O(1)`

```java
public class Solution {
    public void nextPermutation(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
            return;
        }
        int p1 = -1;
        int p2 = -1; 
        for (int i = nums.length - 2; i >= 0; i--) { //find the first element such that nums[i] < nums[i + 1]
            if (nums[i] < nums[i + 1]) {
                p1 = i;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (p1 == -1) { // if no such number existes, which means the array is sorted in descending order, we just reverse the array into ascending order and return
            sort(nums, 0, nums.length - 1);
            return;
        }
        
        for (int i = nums.length - 1; i > p1; i--) { // find the first number that it is greater than nums[p1] we have found
            if (nums[i] > nums[p1]) {
                p2 = i;
                break;
            }
        }
        swap(nums, p1, p2); 
        sort(nums, p1 + 1, nums.length - 1);
    }
    
    private void swap (int[] nums, int p1, int p2) {
        int tmp = nums[p2];
        nums[p2] = nums[p1];
        nums[p1] = tmp;
    }
    
    private void sort(int[] nums, int start, int end) {
        while (start < end) {
            if (nums[start] > nums[end]) {
                swap(nums, start, end);
            }
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }
}
