# Solution1: Deep copy with mapping between old and new nodes, two rounds

In order to make a deep copy of the given LinkedList, we have to not only copy the next pointer, but also copy the random pointer. 
This is the 2 aspects we need to consider in this problem.  

By the time we deep copied the nodes in the original LinkedList in the first rounds, the deep copy of the nodes pointed by the random pointer might have not been constructed yet, so we need an additional iteration to make the random pointer in the deep copied list right. In this case, we need a HashMap for storing the mapping relationship between the original nodes and deep copied nodes.  

In a nutshell, in the first iteration we set the next pointers and in the second iteration we set the random pointers.  

The corner case would be `head == null`, in this case we return `null`. 

Note that there are a very handy trick used here for any LinkedList related traversal problem, that is, to use a dummy head node whose `next` pointer points to the actual head. Using a dummy head node would make the implementation more concise in most cases.  

## Time complexity

`O(2n) = O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input LinkedList.  

## Space complexity

`O(n)` for the HashMap.  

```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node next;
    public Node random;

    public Node() {}

    public Node(int _val,Node _next,Node _random) {
        val = _val;
        next = _next;
        random = _random;
    }
};
*/
class Solution {
    public Node copyRandomList(Node head) {
        if (head == null) return head;
        HashMap<Node, Node> map = new HashMap<>();
        Node p1 = head;
        Node p2 = new Node(0, null, null); // dummy head for the copied list. 

        while (p1 != null) {
            Node tmp = new Node(p1.val, null, null);
            p2.next = tmp;
            map.put(p1, tmp);
            p1 = p1.next;
            p2 = p2.next;
        }
        
        p1 = head;
        while (p1 != null) {
            map.get(p1).random = map.get(p1.random);
            p1 = p1.next;
        }
        
        return map.get(head);
    }
}
```

# Solution2: Deep copy with mapping between old and new nodes, one round

In order to finish the deep copy process within one round, we need to not only copy the current node and its `next` pointer, but also copy the `random` pointer. In this case we could use the HashMap for both storing the mapping relationship and checking if a specific node have been copied or not. There are three aspects for each node we encountered.  

1. If the current node has not been copied yet, we deep copy the current node and put it in the HashMap.  
2. If the node pointed by `next` has not been copied yet, we copy the `next` node and put it in the HashMap. Then we make the `next` pointer the copy of the current node point to the copy of the `next` of the current pointer. 
3. Similar for the `random` of current node. 

## Time complexity

`O(n)`

## Space complexity

`O(n)`

/*
// Definition for a Node.

    public Node(int _val,Node _next,Node _random) {
        val = _val;
        next = _next;
        random = _random;
    }
};
*/
class Solution {
    public Node copyRandomList(Node head) {
        if (head == null) return null;
        
        Node curr = head;
        Map<Node, Node> map = new HashMap<>();
        while (curr != null) {
            if (!map.containsKey(curr)) {
                Node currCopy = new Node(curr.val, null, null);  // copy current node
                map.put(curr, currCopy);
            }
            
            if (curr.next != null) {
                if (!map.containsKey(curr.next)) {
                    Node nextCopy = new Node(curr.next.val, null, null);  // copy next node
                    map.put(curr.next, nextCopy);
                }
                // make the copy's next pointer point to the copy of the next node of the current node. 
                map.get(curr).next = map.get(curr.next);
            }
            
            if (curr.random != null) {
                if (!map.containsKey(curr.random)) {
                    Node randomCopy = new Node(curr.random.val, null, null);  // copy the random node
                    map.put(curr.random, randomCopy);
                }
                // make the copy's random pointer point to the copy of the random node of the current node. 
                map.get(curr).random = map.get(curr.random);
            }
            
            curr = curr.next;
        }
        
        return map.get(head);
    }

# Solution3: Constant space solution with reusing the original random pointer

Three step solution.   
1. Copy the oroginal list node along with the next pointer.  
2. Set the random of the original node to point to its repilca. Then set the random of the replica to its original node's actual random. In this way the mapping relationship previously stored in the HashMap is not stored through manipulating the random pointer of the original list.  
3. Set the random of each of the replica node to `CopiedNode.random.random`, which is now the replica of the random node of the original node. One edge case here is that if the original node's random points to null, then the replica's random is actually null, in this way there is no chain and thus no need to change.  

One might ask why don't we change the random of the original node back thorugh following the chain first: `original.ranodm = replica.random.random; replica.random = replica.random.random`. This statement generates wrong result when the original node's random points to itself, which is that the replica's random will points to the original node after this statement.  

In this way we saved `O(n)` space, but modified the input.  

## Time complexity

`O(3n) = O(n)`

## Space complexity

`O(1)`

        next = _next;
        random = _random;
    }

    public Node copyRandomList(Node head) {
        if (head == null) return null;
        
        Node p1 = head;
        Node p2 = new Node(0, null, null);
        Node dummy = p2;
        // first round, copy the original node along with its next pointer
        while (p1 != null) {
            Node copy = new Node(p1.val, null, null);
            p2.next = copy;
            p1 = p1.next;
            p2 = p2.next;
        }
        
        p1 = head;
        p2 = dummy.next;
        // second round, set the random of the original node to its replica
        // set the random of its replica to the random of the original node
        while (p1 != null) {
            p2.random = p1.random;
            p1.random = p2;
            p1 = p1.next;
            p2 = p2.next;
        }
        
        p1 = head;
        p2 = dummy.next;
        // third round, set the random of the replica to its origin's rendom, which now points to the copied node. 
        while (p1 != null) {
            if (p2.random != null) {
                p2.random = p2.random.random;
            }
            p1 = p1.next;
            p2 = p2.next;

# Solution4: Constant space without changing the input list

Then we would want to know if we could do it without a HashMap. Without using a HashMap, we could solve it within `O(1)` space.  
In order to store the relationship between original node and the newly generated node, we could make use of the next pointer in the original list.  
If we use the next pointer in the original list, we would lose track of the next node in the original list. So we would let the next pointer of the newly generated node pointing to the next node in the original list.  
The algorithm includes three steps:  
1. Iterate through the original list and duplicates each node. The duplicate of each node follows its original node using next pointer of its original node.  
2. Iterate through the new list and assign the random pointer of each duplicate node.  
3. Restore the original list and extract the copied list.
