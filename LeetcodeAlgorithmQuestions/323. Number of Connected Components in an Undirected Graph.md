# Solution1: Union Find

As is indicated by the requirement of the question obviously, this is a dynamic connectivity problem which is suitable to be resolved with Union Find algorithm naturally. 

Here we utilized the optimized version for Union Find algorithm: Weighted Union with path compression. 

```java
class Solution {
    public int countComponents(int n, int[][] edges) {
        UnionFind uf = new UnionFind(n);
        
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            uf.union(edge[0], edge[1]);
        }
        
        return uf.getConnectedGraphCount();
    }
    
    class UnionFind {
        int[] id;
        int[] size;
        
        UnionFind(int n) {
            this.id = new int[n];
            this.size = new int[n];
            
            Arrays.fill(size, 1);
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                id[i] = i;
            }
        }
        
        void union(int i, int j) {
            int rootI = getRoot(i);
            int rootJ = getRoot(j);
            
            if (rootI == rootJ) return;
            if (size[rootI] > size[rootJ]) {
                id[rootJ] = rootI;
                size[i] += size[j];
            } else {
                id[rootI] = rootJ;
                size[j] += size[i];
            }
        }
        
        boolean find(int i, int j) {
            return getRoot(i) == getRoot(j);
        }
        
        int getRoot(int i) {
            while (id[i] != i) {
                id[i] = id[id[i]];
                i = id[i];
            }
            
            return i;
        }
        
        int getConnectedGraphCount() {
            int count = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < id.length; i++) {
                if (id[i] == i) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            
            return count;
        }
    }
}
```

## Time complexity

For a weighted Union with path compression algorithm, the time complexity of unioning `E` edges is `O(E*α(n))` where `α(n)` is the inverse ackermann function that grows exponentially slow. 

## Space complexity

`O(n)` since we used 2 arrays to store the root and size of each vertices.  

# Solution2: DFS

As we need to calculate the number of connected graphs given the input, it is also resolvable through a graph DFS algorithm. In order to map a graph that contains vertices and edges, we can either use an Adjacent List or an Adjacent Matrix. In this question we use the Adjacent List. Using DFS, we can simply start with executing a depth first search against each vertice. Every time when a new vertice is visited, we mark it as visited. With the help of DFS each visit would iterate through all the nodes belong to the same connected graph. And when the nodes for the current DFS iteration is exhausted we know 1 connected graph is found. 

Hence the algorithm is as following:
1. With the input `edges`, we built the adjacent list to model the graph first.   
2. Create a visited array of length `n` to record the visiting status of each node to prevent infinite loop.   
3. For every node from `1` to `n`, if it is not visited, we do a DFS from it.  
4. During the DFS, we mark each node we encountered as visited.  
5. Once this iteration of DFS is completed, we increment the `counter` by `1`. 

```java
class Solution {
    public int countComponents(int n, int[][] edges) {
        List<List<Integer>> adjList = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            adjList.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            adjList.get(edge[0]).add(edge[1]);
            adjList.get(edge[1]).add(edge[0]);
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                count++;
                dfs(i, adjList, visited);
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
    
    private void dfs(int curr, List<List<Integer>> adjList, boolean[] visited) {
        visited[curr] = true;
        
        for (int next : adjList.get(curr)) {
            if (!visited[next]) {
                dfs(next, adjList, visited);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Time complexity 

`O(n+E)`. We spend `O(n+E)` time in building the adjacent list by creating `n` list and visiting each edge once. Then we visit each node and edge at most once during DFS. Hence the total time is `O(n+E)`.  

## Space complexity

`O(n+E)`. The adjacent list is of length `n`, and we store at most `E` edges in it. We also used a visited array with size `n`.
