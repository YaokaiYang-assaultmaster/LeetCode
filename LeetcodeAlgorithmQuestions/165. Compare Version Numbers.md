# Solution1: Comparing each subversion during iteration

Straight forward solution, just iterate through all subversions and compare them. A little trick here is to using `Integer.parseInt()` to solve any edge case like this: `01`. And another trick is to iterate based on the greater length among the 2 versions. And during iteration, assign `0` as the current subversion for the one that is not as long. In this way we unified the way to compare 2 versions with different length and simplified the code. 

## Time complexity 

`O(n)` for iterating through each of the subversions of the two version number, in which `n` is the length of the longer version. 

## Space complexity

`O(n)` for storing the String array generated with split subversions, in which `n` is the length of the longer version. 

```
class Solution {
    public int compareVersion(String version1, String version2) {
        if (version1 == null || version1.equals("") || version2 == null || version2.equals("")) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid version number(s).");
        }
        String[] versions1 = version1.split("\\.");
        String[] versions2 = version2.split("\\.");
        
        for (int i = 0; i < Math.max(versions1.length, versions2.length); i++) {
            Integer v1 = i < versions1.length ? Integer.parseInt(versions1[i]) : 0;
            Integer v2 = i < versions2.length ? Integer.parseInt(versions2[i]) : 0;
            int ret = v1.compareTo(v2);
            if (ret != 0) {
                return ret;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
```
