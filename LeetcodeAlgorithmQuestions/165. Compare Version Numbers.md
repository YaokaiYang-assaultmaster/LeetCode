# Solution Comparing each subversion during iteration

Straight forward solution, just iterate through all subversions and compare them. A little trick here is to using `Integer.parseInt()` to solve any edge case like this: `01`. And another trick is to iterate based on the greater length among the 2 versions. And during iteration, assign `0` as the current subversion for the one that has already been checked every position. In this way we unified the way to compare 2 versions with different length and simplified the code. 

Time complexity: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the longer version. 

Space complexity: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the longer version. 

```
class Solution {
    public int compareVersion(String version1, String version2) {
        String[] versions1 = version1.split("\\.");
        String[] versions2 = version2.split("\\.");
        
        for (int i = 0; i < Math.max(versions1.length, versions2.length); i++) {
            Integer v1 = i < versions1.length ? Integer.parseInt(versions1[i]) : 0;
            Integer v2 = i < versions2.length ? Integer.parseInt(versions2[i]) : 0;
            int ret = v1.compareTo(v2);
            if (ret != 0) {
                return ret;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
```
