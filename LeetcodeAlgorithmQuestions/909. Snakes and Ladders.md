# Solution1: BFS

Consider this as a graph traversal problem. From a given node `curr`, there are 6 possible children nodes we can go to, namingly from `curr + 1` to `curr + 6`. Then for each node, we need to find out its position on the board to decide the final destination. Once we reaches `N*N`, we return the steps taken.  

Another point to note is that how do we prevent from infinite loop. We use a normal way in graph traversal here, that is, to check if current node has been visited or not. And we only visit nodes that are not visited before. The reason is that if we are visiting a previously visited node, that means there exists loop in the board, and thus we will always come back to this node, i.e. the destination `N*N` is not reachable. 

## Time complexity

`O(n^2)` where `n` is the height and width of `board`.  

## Space complexity

`O(n^2)` for the HashMap. Up to `O(n^2)` for the ArrayDeque.  

```java
class Solution {
    public int snakesAndLadders(int[][] board) {
        Deque<Integer> deque = new ArrayDeque<>();
        Map<Integer, Integer> steps = new HashMap<>();
        steps.put(1, 0);
        deque.offer(1);
        int N = board.length;
        while (!deque.isEmpty()) {
            int curr = deque.poll();
            if (curr == N * N) return steps.get(curr);
            
            // BFS
            for (int i = curr + 1; i <= curr + 6 && i <= N * N; i++) {
                int rowCol = getRowCol(i, N);
                int row = rowCol / N;
                int col = rowCol % N;
                int next = board[row][col] == -1 ? i : board[row][col];
                if (!steps.containsKey(next)) {
                    steps.put(next, steps.get(curr) + 1);
                    deque.offer(next);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
    
    private int getRowCol(int i, int N) {
        int wor = (i - 1) / N;  // reverse row
        int loc = (i - 1) % N;  // reverse col
        int row = N - 1 - wor; // from bottom to top
        int col = wor % 2 == 0 ? loc : N - 1 - loc;
        
        return row * N + col;
    }
}
```
