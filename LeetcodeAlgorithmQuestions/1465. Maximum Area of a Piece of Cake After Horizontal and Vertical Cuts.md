# Solution1: Find the max length and width of the rectangular

The question asks to calculate the max area of piece of cake after cut. This is essentially equal to calculate the size of the rectangular once cut the cake following the instructions. Hence the goal is clear,we need to find the max length and width of the rectangular formed by the cuts. The length is the distance between any 2 vertical cuts, and the width is the distance between any 2 horitonzal cuts. Don't forget the include the distance between the edges and the first/last cut when do calculation. 

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int h, int w, int[] horizontalCuts, int[] verticalCuts) {
        Arrays.sort(horizontalCuts);
        Arrays.sort(verticalCuts);
        
        int maxVLen = getMaxGap(verticalCuts, w);
        int maxHLen = getMaxGap(horizontalCuts, h);
        
        long maxArea = (long)maxVLen * maxHLen;
        return (int)(maxArea % (Math.pow(10, 9) + 7));
    }
    
    private int getMaxGap(int[] cuts, int len) {
        int maxGap = Math.max(cuts[0], len - cuts[cuts.length -1]);
        for (int i = 0; i < cuts.length - 1; i++) {
            maxGap = Math.max(cuts[i + 1] - cuts[i], maxGap);
        }
        
        return maxGap;
    }
}
```

## Time complexity

`O(m+n)` where `m=horizontalCuts.length` and `n=verticalCuts.length`.  

## Space complexity

`O(1)`
