# Solution1: Brute force

According to the description, each visit is specified by a 3-tuple as `[user, timestamp, website]`. And what we want is to find out the most common 3-sequence website visited by users and it should be the lexicographically smallest one. Note that the 3-sequence websites does not have to adjacent to each other, meaning it can be any 3-sequence out of the user's visit history. 

Hence we could follow the below straightforward algorithm to get the result:  
1. Identify the visit of websites, ordered by timestamp, for each user.  
2. Find out all the possible 3-sequence of each user visit history and update the count in a HashMap. Note we need to make sure for the same visit sequence of a user we only add its count by 1 since the question asks for the sequence visited by the most users (not visited the most times).  
3. Find out the 3-sequence that is visited by the most of the user and is also lexicographically smallest out of the count map. 

## Time complexity

We have to sort the visits based on timestamp, which takes `O(nlogn)`. We also have to iterate through all the possible 3-sequences, which takes `O(n^3)` time. 

So the time complexity is `O(nlogn) + O(n^3) = O(n^3)`.  

## Space complexity

We have to keep 1 hashmap for the visit list of each user, 1 hashmap for the count, and 1 hashset for the visited sequence of each user, so it would be `O(3n) = O(n)` in total. 

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> mostVisitedPattern(String[] username, int[] timestamp, String[] website) {
        List<String> ret = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Illegal inputs
        if (username.length == 0 || timestamp.length == 0 || website.length == 0) return ret;
        if (username.length != timestamp.length || username.length != website.length 
            || website.length != timestamp.length) return ret;
        
        Map<String, List<Visit>> userVisit = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < username.length; i++) {
            userVisit.putIfAbsent(username[i], new ArrayList<Visit>());
            userVisit.get(username[i]).add(new Visit(timestamp[i], website[i]));
        }
        
        Map<String, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
        String maxSeq = "";
        for (String user : userVisit.keySet()) {
            Set<String> existed = new HashSet<>();
            List<Visit> visits= userVisit.get(user);
            Collections.sort(visits, (a, b) -> {return a.timestamp - b.timestamp;});
            for (int i = 0; i < visits.size() - 2; i++) {
                for (int j = i + 1; j < visits.size() - 1; j++) {
                    for (int k = j + 1; k < visits.size(); k++) {
                        String seq = visits.get(i).website + "," + visits.get(j).website + "," + visits.get(k).website;
                if (!existed.contains(seq)) {
                    existed.add(seq);
                    count.put(seq, count.getOrDefault(seq, 0) + 1);
                }
                if (maxSeq.equals("") || count.get(maxSeq) < count.get(seq) || (count.get(maxSeq) == count.get(seq) && maxSeq.compareTo(seq) > 0)) {
                    maxSeq = seq;
                }       
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        for (String ele : maxSeq.split(",")) {
            ret.add(ele);
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
}

class Visit {
    int timestamp;
    String website;
    
    public Visit(int timestamp, String website) {
        this.website = website;
        this.timestamp = timestamp;
    }
}
