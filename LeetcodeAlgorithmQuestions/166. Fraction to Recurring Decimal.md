# Solution1: Straightforward solution

Follow the normal process we would go through for a division. We starts with the integer portion of the result, and then calculate the decimal portion. 

Note there are several steps we need to go through:  
1. Decide the sign of the result. We know that the result will be negative if and only if the numerator and denominator are of different sign symbols. This could be achieved via a XOR operation.   
2. After the sign of the result is decided, we could take the absolute value of the numerator and denominator. Here we need to use `long` for conversion, since the absolute value of `-2147483648(Integer.MIN_VALUE)` will overflow.   
3. Decide the integer part of the result. Since this can be calculated with only one step, as opposed to decimal part.  
4. Get the remainder of the calculation, which should be the start point of the decimal part calculation. If `remainder` is 0, the calculation is done. Otherwise, we need to add a `"."` to the result and continue.  
5. Initialize a Map to store the remainder to its position in the decimal part. Once we find a remainder that already exists in the result, we know that the repeating part begins to its corresponding position stored in the map, and we could enclose the corresponding sequence with a parenthesis. After this step, we could return the result directly.     
6. Otherwise, we would multiply the remainder with 10 and starts the division, then we update the remainder again.  

## Time complexity

`O(n)` where `n` is the number of digits in the result. 

## Space complexity

`O(n)`

```java
class Solution {
    public String fractionToDecimal(int numerator, int denominator) {
        if (numerator == 0) {
            return "0";
        }
        if (denominator == 0) {
            throw new ArithmeticException("Divided by zero");
        }
        
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        if (numerator < 0 ^ denominator < 0) {
            sb.append("-");
        }
        
        // Deal with the integer part of the result first
        // need to use long cause Math.abs(Integer.MIN_VALUE) would cause overflow
        long Lnumerator = Math.abs(Long.valueOf(numerator));
        long Ldenominator = Math.abs(Long.valueOf(denominator));
        sb.append(String.valueOf(Lnumerator / Ldenominator));
        
        long remainder = Lnumerator % Ldenominator;
        if (remainder == 0) {
            return sb.toString();
        }
        sb.append(".");
        Map<Long, Integer> posMap = new HashMap<>();
        while (remainder != 0) {
            if (posMap.containsKey(remainder)) {
                sb.insert(posMap.get(remainder), "(");
                sb.append(")");
                return sb.toString();
            }
            posMap.put(remainder, sb.length());
            remainder *= 10;
            sb.append(String.valueOf(remainder / Ldenominator));
            remainder = remainder % Ldenominator;
        }
        
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```
