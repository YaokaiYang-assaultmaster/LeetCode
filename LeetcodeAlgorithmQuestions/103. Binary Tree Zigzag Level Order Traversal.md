# Solution1: Iterative BFS with reversed visiting sequence at each level

This question is essentially a BFS problem with special requirment, that is, to reverse the traversal order at each level. 
Specifically, with treating root as the `0` level, at even levels we iterate from left to right. And at odd levels we iterate from right to left.  

Sinc the child of the node that is being visited at last in previous level is being visited first, we should store the nodes in a FILO style, which can be realized using a stack, or Deque in Java. 
Also, we have to change the sequence of visiting left and right child of nodes at each level. In odd levels, we need to visit nodes from right to left while at next level we need to visit in the opposite direction. Hence we need to visit right child first for each node at the odd levels. And vice versa for the even levels. 

## Time complexity

`O(n)` time since each node is visited exactly once. Here `n` refers to the number of nodes in the Tree. 

## Space complexity

## Potential optimization

We are using a new ArrayDeque at each level, which leads to a lot of object initialization and garbage collection work.
However, during the whole proess, the reason why we need so many ArrayDeque is that we cannot mix the results of current level into next level's Deque. 
Hence we can actually have two ArrayDeque, which is used as stack here, in our hands at the beginning of the iteration. 
Then each time we are visiting a level, we put the results in the other Deque. 
And at the end of a level iteration, the current Deque we used is actually empty and hence can be reused for storing next level's children nodes. 

`O(n)` for the Deques used. 

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
 
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> zigzagLevelOrder(TreeNode root) {
        List<List<Integer>> ret = new ArrayList<>();
        if (root == null) {
            return ret;
        }
        
        Deque<TreeNode> deque = new ArrayDeque<>();
        deque.offerLast(root);
        zigzagHelper(deque, 0, ret);
        return ret;
    }
    
    private static void zigzagHelper(Deque<TreeNode> deque, int level, List<List<Integer>> ret) {
        while (!deque.isEmpty()) {
            int size = deque.size();
            List<Integer> tmp = new ArrayList<>();
            Deque<TreeNode> nextLevel = new ArrayDeque<>();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                TreeNode curr = deque.pollLast();
                tmp.add(curr.val);
                if ((level + 1) % 2 != 0) {
                    if (curr.left != null) nextLevel.offerLast(curr.left);
                    if (curr.right != null) nextLevel.offerLast(curr.right);
                }
                else if ((level + 1) % 2 == 0) {
                    if (curr.right != null) nextLevel.offerLast(curr.right);
                    if (curr.left != null) nextLevel.offerLast(curr.left);
                }
            }
            ret.add(tmp);
            deque = nextLevel;
            level++;
        }
    }
}
```

# Solution2: Reverse the traversal result of specific levels

We can still traverse the tree in normal order, while storing the results of each level in independent arrays. 
Afterwards we just reverse the results of odd levels. 

This can be achieved on top of any normal tree traversal algorithms as long as they preserve the level-wise order of the tree's nodes. 

## Time complexity

`O(n)`

## Space complexity

`O(n)`

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> zigzagLevelOrder(TreeNode root) {
        List<List<Integer>> ret = new ArrayList<>();
        if (root == null) return ret;
        this.dfs(root, ret, 0);
        this.zigzagAdjust(ret);
        return ret;
    }
    
    private void dfs(TreeNode root, List<List<Integer>> ret, int level) {
        if (ret.size() <= level) {
            ret.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        
        ret.get(level).add(root.val);
        if (root.left != null) {
            dfs(root.left, ret, level + 1);
        }
        if (root.right != null) {
            dfs(root.right, ret, level + 1);
        }
    }
    
    private void zigzagAdjust(List<List<Integer>> ret) {
        for (int i = 0; i < ret.size(); i++) {
            if (i % 2 != 0) {
                Collections.reverse(ret.get(i));
            }
        }
    }
}
