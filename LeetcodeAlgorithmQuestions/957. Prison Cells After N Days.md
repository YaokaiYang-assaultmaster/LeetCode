# Solution1: Simulation with repeadted pattern

A straightfowward solution to this question is to generate state for each iteration for `N` times. However, this gets TLE when `N` becomes very large. But there is someway to optimize the time complexity such that we do not need to simulate each iteration. 

There are 8 cells in total in the array, and each cell can have 2 states, `1` and `0`. So the total number of possible conditions are fixed, which is `2^8`. This means once the number `N` becomes very large, the pattern will begin to repeat itself. So we keep a `seen` HashMap mapping a state to the iteration index. Each time we meet a state that is in `seen`, we know that it occured `t` steps before. Hence we could fast forward `N` to be `N = N % t`, here `t = seen.get(state) - N`. 

Also note that the first and last position in the `cells` are always `0`, so we only need to consider position `1` to `6`.  

## Time complexity

`O(2^N)` when `N` is small. `O(N)` when `N` is large. 

## Space complexity

`O(2^8)`

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] prisonAfterNDays(int[] cells, int N) {
        Map<String, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>();
        while (N > 0) {
            int[] cells2 = new int[8];
            seen.put(Arrays.toString(cells), N);
            N--;
            for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
                if (cells[i - 1] == cells[i + 1]) {
                    cells2[i] = 1;
                }
            }
            cells = cells2;
            if (seen.containsKey(Arrays.toString(cells))) {
                N = N % (seen.get(Arrays.toString(cells)) - N);
            }
        }
        
        return cells;
    }
}
```
