# Solution1: BFS  with vertical index

Vertical order traversal includes 2 aspects: horizontal index and vertical index. A vertical order traversal is to visit the nodes from top to bottom, from left to right. And we need to output the traversal result orderred by vertical index. 

For tree traversal, normally there are 2 methods, BFS and DFS. Since we want to visit the nodes from top to bottom, left to right, BFS can be picked since it preserve the horizontal index naturally (visit from top to bottom). Hence we just need to add extra logic during the traversal to keep the vertical index. Given BFS visits from left to right, and we don't know the width of the tree upon start, we can assume the root if at index 0. Every time we move left one step (go to left child), we minus 1 to the index; every time we move right one step (go to right child), we add 1 to the index. And during the traversal, we can keep a HashMap to record the traversal result list corresponding to each vertical index. 

So the algorithm would be described as following:  
1. Create a HashMap to store the traversal result of each vertical index, where root node is at index `0`.  
2. As is a standard practice in BFS, create a Queue to store the nodes visited. In addition, create another Queue to store the vertical index of each node. 
3. While the queue is not empty, take out the first element `curr` of the queue and put its value in the corresponding list of HashMap. Put its left child in the queue with vertical index `curr.idx - 1`, and put its right child in the queue with vertical index `curr.idx + 1`.  
4. Sort the key of the HashMap and output the lists.  

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> verticalOrder(TreeNode root) {
        List<List<Integer>> ret = new ArrayList<>();
        if (root == null ) return ret;
        
        Deque<TreeNode> nodeDeque = new ArrayDeque<>();
        Deque<Integer> vIndex = new ArrayDeque<>();
        addNode(nodeDeque, vIndex, root, 0);
        
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> columns = new HashMap<>();  // If we use a TreeMap<>() here then the map is automatically sorted by keys
        
        while (!nodeDeque.isEmpty()) {
            TreeNode curr = nodeDeque.poll();
            int currIdx = vIndex.poll();
            columns.computeIfAbsent(currIdx, k -> new ArrayList<Integer>()).add(curr.val);
            if (curr.left != null) {
                addNode(nodeDeque, vIndex, curr.left, currIdx - 1);
            }
            if (curr.right != null) {
                addNode(nodeDeque, vIndex, curr.right, currIdx + 1);
            }
        }
        
        List<Integer> sortedIdx = new ArrayList<>(columns.keySet());
        Collections.sort(sortedIdx);
        for(int idx : sortedIdx) {
            ret.add(new ArrayList<>(columns.get(idx))); // copy the list from the map into the return list
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
    
    private void addNode(Deque<TreeNode> nodeDeque, Deque<Integer> vIndex, TreeNode node, int vIdx) {
        nodeDeque.offer(node);
        vIndex.offer(vIdx);
    }
}
```

## Time complexity

Assume there are `n` nodes in the tree, `O(n)` time needed to traverse every nodes. `O((logn)log(logn))` time needed to sort the keys of the HashMap, and then `O(n)` to copy the result lists. So `O(n)` time in total.  

## Space complexity

`O(2*n)` for the queue, `O(n)` for the HashMap, which is `O(n)` in total.
