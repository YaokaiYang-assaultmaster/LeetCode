# Solution1: BFS  with vertical index

Vertical order traversal includes 2 aspects: horizontal index and vertical index. A vertical order traversal is to visit the nodes from top to bottom, from left to right. And we need to output the traversal result orderred by vertical index. 

For tree traversal, normally there are 2 methods, BFS and DFS. Since we want to visit the nodes from top to bottom, left to right, BFS can be picked since it preserve the horizontal index naturally (visit from top to bottom). Hence we just need to add extra logic during the traversal to keep the vertical index. Given BFS visits from left to right, and we don't know the width of the tree upon start, we can assume the root if at index 0. Every time we move left one step (go to left child), we minus 1 to the index; every time we move right one step (go to right child), we add 1 to the index. And during the traversal, we can keep a HashMap to record the traversal result list corresponding to each vertical index. 

So the algorithm would be described as following:  
1. Create a HashMap to store the traversal result of each vertical index, where root node is at index `0`.  
2. As is a standard practice in BFS, create a Queue to store the nodes visited. In addition, create another Queue to store the vertical index of each node. 
3. While the queue is not empty, take out the first element `curr` of the queue and put its value in the corresponding list of HashMap. Put its left child in the queue with vertical index `curr.idx - 1`, and put its right child in the queue with vertical index `curr.idx + 1`.  
4. Sort the key of the HashMap and output the lists.  

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> verticalOrder(TreeNode root) {
        List<List<Integer>> ret = new ArrayList<>();
        if (root == null ) return ret;
        
        Deque<TreeNode> nodeDeque = new ArrayDeque<>();
        Deque<Integer> vIndex = new ArrayDeque<>();
        addNode(nodeDeque, vIndex, root, 0);
        
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> columns = new HashMap<>();  // If we use a TreeMap<>() here then the map is automatically sorted by keys
        
        while (!nodeDeque.isEmpty()) {
            TreeNode curr = nodeDeque.poll();
            int currIdx = vIndex.poll();
            columns.computeIfAbsent(currIdx, k -> new ArrayList<Integer>()).add(curr.val);
            if (curr.left != null) {
                addNode(nodeDeque, vIndex, curr.left, currIdx - 1);
            }
            if (curr.right != null) {
                addNode(nodeDeque, vIndex, curr.right, currIdx + 1);
            }
        }
        
        List<Integer> sortedIdx = new ArrayList<>(columns.keySet());
        Collections.sort(sortedIdx);
        for(int idx : sortedIdx) {
            ret.add(new ArrayList<>(columns.get(idx))); // copy the list from the map into the return list
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
    
    private void addNode(Deque<TreeNode> nodeDeque, Deque<Integer> vIndex, TreeNode node, int vIdx) {
        nodeDeque.offer(node);
        vIndex.offer(vIdx);
    }
}
```

## Time complexity

Assume there are `n` nodes in the tree, `O(n)` time needed to traverse every nodes. `O(wlogw)` time needed to sort the keys of the HashMap in which `w` is the width of the tree, and then `O(n)` to copy the result lists. In the worst case where the tree is totally imbalanced into 1 branch, `w = n`. So  the overall time complexity is `O(nlogn)` in the worst case.  

## Space complexity

`O(2*n)` for the queue, `O(n)` for the HashMap, which is `O(n)` in total. 

# Solution2: DFS

We can also use DFS to traverse the tree to get the final result. Given the above analysis, we already know that we need 2 variable to identify a nodes position, it's vertical index (relative position to the root) and its depth. While BFS automatically preserves the depth during the traversal, we can keep an extra variable for the depth in DFS. Meanwhile, since the question asked "If two nodes are in the same row and column, the order should be from left to right" we need to ensure that left childs are visited prior to right ones. Hence we have the following algorithm.  

1. Create a HashMap to store the list of `{depth, val}` pairs for each vertical index.  
2. Preorder DFS the tree.  
3. For every node encountered, put `{depth, val}` to the corresponding list of the vertical index.   
4. After the iteration, sort the list under each vertical index based on depth and return the result based on the order of vertical index.  

Note here we used a TreeMap to store the list under each vertical index so there is no need to sort the keys of the map. 

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    class Pair {
        int row;
        int val;
        
        Pair(int row, int val) {
            this.row = row;
            this.val = val;
        }
    }
    public List<List<Integer>> verticalOrder(TreeNode root) {
        List<List<Integer>> ret = new ArrayList<>();
        if (root == null) return ret;
        
        Map<Integer, List<Pair>> columns = new TreeMap<>();
        
        preOrder(columns, root, 0, 0);
        
        for (int key : columns.keySet()) {
            Collections.sort(columns.get(key), (a, b) -> {
                return a.row - b.row;
            });
            
            List<Integer> sortedColumn = new ArrayList<>();
            for (Pair p : columns.get(key)) {
                sortedColumn.add(p.val);
            }
            ret.add(sortedColumn);
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
    
    private void preOrder(Map<Integer, List<Pair>> map, TreeNode node, int row, int vIndex) {
        if (node == null) {
            return;
        }
        
        map.computeIfAbsent(vIndex, k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(new Pair(row, node.val));
        
        preOrder(map, node.left, row + 1, vIndex - 1);
        preOrder(map, node.right, row + 1, vIndex + 1);
    }
}
```

## Time complexity

`O(n)` time is used to traverse the tree using DFS. Afterwards we sorted the HashMap, which takes `O(w*hlogh)` time in which `w` is the width of the tree and `h` is the height of the tree. Note `n<w*h` so `O(n)` is dominated by `O(w*hlogh)`. Then we add all the results in the return array which takes `O(n)` time again. So the time complexity is `O(w*hlogh)`.  

In the case when the binary tree is totally imbalanced, in each vertical index there is only 1 node so the sort time of the HashMap is `O(n*1log1)=O(n)`. Hence the total time complexity in this case is `O(1)`.  

## Space complexity

`O(n)` for the HashMap, `O(n)` for the return list, `O(n)` for the recursion call stack, so the overall space complexity is `O(n)`.
