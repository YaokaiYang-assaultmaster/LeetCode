# Solution1: Brute force algorithm

We need to find out the largest square that are formed by `'1'`s within the input `matrix`. The requirement is fairly straightforward, so how should we approach it? 

In order to find out the square that contains only `'1'`, starting from the upper left cell, we need to visit each cell in the matrix and check the squares constructed by cells to the right side and downwards (that is, visiting diagonally). Note we do now need to visit cells to the left side because that is already checked in the previous step. In conclusion, for each cell we are currently on, we would increase the row and column index by 1, 2, 3 ... and check whether the constructed square only contains 1. If so, we update the current max area of of the square if needed. 

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximalSquare(char[][] matrix) {
        int ret = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < matrix[0].length; j++) {
                if (matrix[i][j] == '1') {
                    int currMax = checkSquare(matrix, i, j);
                    ret = Math.max(currMax, ret);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
    
    private int checkSquare(char[][] matrix, int i, int j) {
        int boundary = Math.min(matrix.length - i, matrix[0].length - j);
        for (int delta = 0; delta < boundary; delta++) {
            for (int deltaI = 0; deltaI <= delta; deltaI++) {
                for (int deltaJ = 0; deltaJ <= delta; deltaJ++) {
                    if (matrix[i + deltaI][j + deltaJ] != '1') { // if a 1 is found, we return the max square size found in the previous layer
                        return delta * delta;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return boundary * boundary;
    }
}
```

## Time complexity

`O((mn)^2)`. In the worst case, for every cell of the matrix, we need to visit all the other cells. 

## Space complexity

`O(1)`
