# Solution1: Count and check

This question basically contains for 2 parts:  
1. Found the count of each word.   
2. Check all the `(word, count)` pair to find the word that is not in the input `banned[]` list which has the highest count among all the words. 

So this makes it pretty straightfowward to solve it. 

Note that in order to get all words from the paragraph, considering that there are a lot of possible splitters, we need to first replace all symbols into spaces and then split based on 1 or more spaces. This makes us being able to handle cases like: `"a, a,   b,b, c,d,d d d"`, in which we need split both `","` and `" "`. 

We first store all the `(word, count)` pairs into a HashMap. Then we store all the words in `banned[]` into a HashSet for quick existance checking. Finally we iterate through the HashMap to find the word we want.  

Suppose there are `m` words in `paragraph` and `n` words in `banned`

## Time complexity

Time complexity: `O(2m + n)`

## Space complexity

Space complexity: `O(m + n)`


```Java
class Solution {
    public String mostCommonWord(String paragraph, String[] banned) {
        String[] words = paragraph.toLowerCase().replaceAll("\\W+", " ").split("\\s+");
        Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (String word : words) {
            map.put(word, map.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
        }
                        
        Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (String word : banned) {
            set.add(word);
        }
        
        String ret = "";
        int max = 0;
        for (String key : map.keySet()) {
            if (!set.contains(key) && map.get(key) > max) {
                ret = key;
                max = map.get(key);
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
}
```

# Solution2: Counting

Without using the regex, we could still split and construct the words. Basically we need to iterate through each character, if it is a letter, then we put it to current word. Otherwist we have found a word and thus need to examine it by increasing the total frequency and check if it is the local optimal result. 

## Time complexity

`O(n)` where `n` is the number of characters in the paragraph. 

## Space complexity

`O(m+b)` where `m` is the number of words in paragraph and `b` is the number of words in `banned`. 

```java
class Solution {
    public String mostCommonWord(String paragraph, String[] banned) {
        paragraph = paragraph.toLowerCase();
        paragraph += ".";
        Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (String word : banned) {
            set.add(word);
        }
        
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        int maxFreq = 0;
        Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        String ret = "";
        char[] p = paragraph.toCharArray();
        for (char c: p) {
            if (Character.isLetter(c)) {
                sb.append(c);
            } else if (sb.length() > 0) {
                String tmp = sb.toString();
                if (!set.contains(tmp)) {
                    map.put(tmp, map.getOrDefault(tmp, 0) + 1);
                    if (map.get(tmp) > maxFreq) {
                        maxFreq = map.get(tmp);
                        ret = tmp;
                    }
                }
                sb = new StringBuilder();
            }
        }
        
        System.out.println(map);
        
        return ret;
    }
}
```
