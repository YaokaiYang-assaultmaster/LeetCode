# Solution1: Brute force iteration

First of all, we need to fully understand the meaning of the question. The question states 2 input for the function, in which we are trying to find "next great number" of of numbers in `nums1` within `nums2`. Note that the definition of "next great number" is tricky here. Given a number `a` from `nums1`, the "next great number" refers to the first number in `nums2` that is greater than `a` and is on the right of the number `a` in `nums2`. How do we guarantee that there is also a number `a` in `nums2`? Well the question states that `nums1` is a subset of `nums2`, while numbers in both `nums1` and `nums2` are unique, which indicates that for any given number `a` in `nums1`, there will always be one and only one `a` in `nums2` as well. 

With the above definition in mind, the brute force solution of the question is straightforward. 

1. Iterate through each number in `nums1`, say `i`.  
2. Find the occurence of number `i` in `nums2`.  
3. Find the first number on the right of number `i` in `nums2`that is greater than `i`.  
4. For any number `i` in `nums1` which cannot satisfy `3`, put `-1` as the result.  

Java implementation as following.  

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] nextGreaterElement(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        if (nums1 == null || nums1.length == 0 || nums2 == null || nums2.length == 0) {
            return new int[]{};
        }
        
        int[] ret = new int[nums1.length];
        Arrays.fill(ret, -1);
        for (int i = 0; i < nums1.length; i++) {
            boolean found = false;
            for (int j = 0; j < nums2.length; j++) {
                if (nums2[j] == nums1[i]) {
                    found = true;
                }
                if (found && nums2[j] > nums1[i]) {
                    ret[i] = nums2[j];
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
}
```

## Time complexity

`O(m*n)` where `m=nums1.length` and `n=nums2.length`, as for each number in `nums1` we iterate every number in `nums2`.    

## Space complexity

`O(m)` for the array used to store return value.
