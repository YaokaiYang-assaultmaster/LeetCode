# Solution1: Recursively consider longest increasing and decreasing sequence

Compared with [298. Binary Tree Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://github.com/YaokaiYang-assaultmaster/LeetCode/blob/master/LeetcodeAlgorithmQuestions/298.%20Binary%20Tree%20Longest%20Consecutive%20Sequence.md), this question includes more different conditions since it allows for:  
1. both increasing and decreasing order from a follows the parent-child path.  
2. child-parent-child path.  

Hence this question actually contains 2 subproblems to solve:  
1. what is the longest __increasing__ consecutive parent-child path sequence given a `root` node?  
2. what is the longest __decreasing__ consecutive parent-child path sequence given a `root` node? 

Based on the above 2 sub-solution, we know that the longest consecutive sequence for a given `root` is `longest_increasing_sequence + longest_decreasing_sequence` from this `root`. We can simply add up this 2 value because the longest increasing consecutive sequence and longest decreasing consecutive sequence is guaranteed to showed up in different child path (otherwise there will be a contradiction--a child's value cannot be greater than and less than the root's value at the same time).  

If the root's value's value is not consecutive with a child's value, then the length of current sequence is simply 1.  

Time complexity: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.  

Space complexity: `O(logn)` on average for the recursion stack since this is a binary tree.  

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    int max = 0;
    public int longestConsecutive(TreeNode root) {
        getLongestConsecutive(root);
        return max;
    }
    
    private int[] getLongestConsecutive(TreeNode root) {
        // returns [longest_decreasing_length_from_root, longest_increasing_length_from_root]
        if (root == null) return new int[]{0, 0};
        int[] left = getLongestConsecutive(root.left);
        int[] right = getLongestConsecutive(root.right);
        int dcr = 1, icr = 1;
        if (root.left != null) {
            if (root.left.val == root.val + 1) {
                icr = left[1] + 1;
            }
            if (root.left.val == root.val - 1) {
                dcr = left[0] + 1;
            }
        }
        if (root.right != null) {
            if (root.right.val == root.val + 1) {
                icr = Math.max(icr, right[1] + 1);
            } if (root.right.val == root.val - 1) {
                dcr = Math.max(dcr, right[0] + 1);
            }
        }
        max = Math.max(max, dcr + icr - 1);
        return new int[]{dcr, icr};
    }
}
```
