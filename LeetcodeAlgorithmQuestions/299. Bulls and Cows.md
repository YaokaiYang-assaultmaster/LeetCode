# Solution1: Count the numbers

Thiis question asks us to get how may so called _bulls_ and _cows_ are there in `guess` based on `secret`. A _bull_ means an integer in `guess` that is the same with the integer at the same position in `secret`. And a _cow_ means an integer in `guess` that has a match in `secret` but not at the same position. And we need to pay attention here that an integer in `secret` can only be matched for one time. E.g. for `secret = "1231"` and `guess = "1111"`, the result should be `"1A1B"`.  

Considering that the question specifies that the 2 input only contains digits, we can probably use an int array of length 10 as a HashMap to store the matching status.  

Given that `secret` and `guess` are of the same length:   
1. For `bull`, the condition is simple. If a digit at the same position `i`, i.e. `secret.charAt(i) == guess.charAt(i)`, then a `bull` is found.   
2. For `cow`, since it means that a match at different position is found in `guess`, we need to keep the information for digits showed up in `guess` and `secret`. In order to save the information in a single HashMap, in this case, an array, we need to store the 2 position information in one cell. How could we do this? The answer is to plus one for one condition and minus one for the other (in the following implementation we add 1 for a digit in `secret` and minus 1 for a digit in `guess`). In this way, for a digit `d`, there are 2 condition:   
  1. If `numbers[d]` > 0, then this digit occurs more in `secret` than in `guess`. Thus if we encounter this digit in `guess`, we should increase `cow`.   
  2. If `numbers[d]` < 0, then this digit occurs more in `guess` than in `secret`. Thus if we encounter this digit in `secret`, we should increase `cow`.  

Time complexity: `O(n)` given `n` is the length of `secret` and `guess`.  

Space complexity: `O(n)`  

```Java
class Solution {
    public String getHint(String secret, String guess) {
        char[] arr1 = secret.toCharArray();
        char[] arr2 = guess.toCharArray();
        int[] numbers = new int[10];
        int bull = 0;
        int cow = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
            int s = arr1[i] - '0';
            int g = arr2[i] - '0';
            if (s == g) {
                bull++;
            } else {
                if (numbers[s] < 0) cow++;
                if (numbers[g] > 0) cow++;
                numbers[s]++;
                numbers[g]--;
            }
        }
        
        return bull + "A" + cow + "B";
    }
}
```
