# Solution1: Bruteforce recursion ï¼ˆTime limie exceeded)

First of all, let's pause for a second and figure how many variables are there in the question that could impact the results. 
The inputs for the question are  `k` and `prices`. But they are not essentially our ultimate variables to consider. The variables, that decides the final results, are `k`, the `start` point of the array, and the `end` point of the array, in which `start` and `end` identifies the trade window within which we completed the transaction.  

Once we have the variables in mind, we can see that this question in itself complies with the recursion strucure. That is, a given problem with input `k` and `prices` (`maxProfit(k, prices, start, end)`) can be solved by figuring out the following sub-problems:  
1. For any given subarray of `prices` specified by `i` and `j` where `start <= i < j <= end, what is the profit we can make by doing one transaction in the subarray?  
2. What is the maximum profit we can make out of the remaining subarray of `prices` specified by `end + 1` and `prices.length - 1` given we can make `k - 1` trades (`maxProfit(k - 1, prices, j + 1, end)`)?  

The recursion stopping condition would be when `k <= 0` or subarray reaches size 0.

The result would be the maximum value we can get out of the sub-results, if we iteratively check every possible `i,j` combination out of `start,end`. 

Straightforwardly, we have the following algorithm. 

## Time complexity

`T(n) = 1 * T(n-1) + 2 * T(n-2) + 3 * T(n-3) + ... + (n-1) * T(1) = O(n^n)`. This is a very large time complexity which means this algorithm cannot be solved in realistic time. Here `n` means the length of the input array. 

## Space complexity

`O(n)` since the recursion stack can be `O(n)` in depth at most. 

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int k, int[] prices) {
        if (k <= 0 || prices == null || prices.length == 0) return 0;
        return maxProfit(k, prices, 0, prices.length - 1);
    }
    
    private int maxProfit(int k, int[] prices, int  start, int end) {
        if (k <= 0 || start == end) return 0;
        int ret = 0;
        for (int i = start; i <= end - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j <= end; j++) {
                if (prices[j] - prices[i] <= 0) continue;
                int currProfit = prices[j] - prices[i];
                int nextProfit = maxProfit(k - 1, prices, j + 1, end);
                ret = Math.max(currProfit + nextProfit, ret);
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
}
```

# Solution2: Dynamic Programming + Quick Path trick

As we can see in the above solution, if we do not do some sort of caching, then we are never going to solve this problem in a reasonable amount of time, since we are solving the same sub-question in the recursion function again and again. This leads to the resulting exponential runtime for the algorithm. 

So, we need to define the recursive function of the problem and its data storage schema.  

Given day `j`, if we have made `i` transactions up to day `j`, then we know that the maximum profit we can make should lie in one of the following conditions:  
1. The maximum profit is the same as the profit we can make on making `i` transactions up to day `j-1`.  
2. The maximum profit is the maximum out of the following sub-conditions: for every day `prev` where `prev` satisfies the requirement `0 <= prev <=j-1`, assume `profit[i-1][prev]` represents the max profit we can make for using up to `i-1` transactions until day `prev`, the profit that can be made on day `j` is `prices[j] - prices[prev] + profit[i-1][prev]`.   

With this induction, we can get the recursive equation as following:

```profit[i][j] = max(profit[i][j-1], profit[i-1][prev] + prices[j] - prices[prev] where 0<=prev<=j-1)```  

__And the base case for the recursive equation would be `profit[0][*] = 0`, `profit[*][0] = 0`, which means that for any given dates, if we make `0` transactions, the maximum profit would be `0` and for any given number of transactions, we will always make `0` profit on day `0`, respectively.__  

However, even with the cache, we still get TLE. The reason is that, we need to get rid of some of the edge cases in which the number of transactions is greater then or equal to half the length of the input `prives`. Hereby, we just try to get all the profit we can get by buying and selling on the consecutive days whenever there are positive gaps.  

## Time complexity

`O(k * n^2)` where `n` is the length of the input `prices` array. 

## Space complexity

`O(k * n)` for the cache. 

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int k, int[] prices) {
        if (k <= 0 || prices == null || prices.length == 0) return 0;
        
        if (k >= prices.length / 2) return quickPath(prices);
        
        int[][] mem = new int[k + 1][prices.length];
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < prices.length; j++) {
                for (int prev = 0; prev < j; prev++) {
                    int currProfit = prices[j] - prices[prev];
                    mem[i][j] = Math.max(mem[i][j], Math.max(mem[i][j - 1], currProfit + mem[i - 1][prev]));
                }
            }
        }
        
        return mem[k][prices.length - 1];
    }
    
    private int quickPath(int[] prices) {
        int ret = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            ret += Math.max(0, prices[i] - prices[i - 1]);
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
}
```

# Solution3: Further optimization for Solution 2

Based on what we learned in solution 2, we know that the recursive equation for the problem is as following:  

```
profit[i][j] = max(profit[i][j-1], profit[i-1][prev] + prices[j] - prices[prev] where 0<=prev<=j-1)
```

However, it can be further rewrite into:   

```
profit[i][j] = max(profit[i][j-1], price[j] + max(profit[i-1][prev] - prices[prev]) where 0<=prev<=j-1)
```

As a result, we have the following implementation.  

## Time complexity

`O(k*n)` where `n` is the length of the input array `prices`.  

## Space complexity

`O(k*n)` for the intermediate result cache.  

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int k, int[] prices) {
        if (k <= 0 || prices == null || prices.length == 0) return 0;
        
        if (k >= prices.length / 2) return quickPath(prices);
        
        int[][] mem = new int[k + 1][prices.length];
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
            int localMax = -prices[0]; // initial value of localMax = 0 - prices[0] = -prices[0]
            for (int j = 1; j < prices.length; j++) {
                mem[i][j] = Math.max(mem[i][j - 1], prices[j] + localMax);
                
                // will be used in next iteration
                // get max(profit[i-1][prev] - prices[prev]) for each step consecutively
                localMax = Math.max(localMax, mem[i - 1][j] - prices[j]);
            }
        }
        
        return mem[k][prices.length - 1];
    }
    
    private int quickPath(int[] prices) {
        int ret = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            ret += Math.max(0, prices[i] - prices[i - 1]);
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
}
```
