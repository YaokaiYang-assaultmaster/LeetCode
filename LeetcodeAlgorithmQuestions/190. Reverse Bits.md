# Solution1: Bit manipulation

The problem requires us to reverse every bits in a 32-bit integer, i.e. put the `i-th` bit in the integer at the `(32-i)th` position. For example, given 3 bits `011` we should revere it into `110`.  

So a straightforward solution would be to take out every bits at position `i` (from right to left) where `0<=i<=32` from a input integer `n` and put it at the `32-i`th position in the result integer (from right to left). In this process, we utilize a mask integer of which bits at all positions but `i` is 0, and the bit at `i-th` position is `1` to extract the bit at `i-th` position of the input integer `n`. See following implementation.  

## Time complexity

`O(l)` where `n` is the number of bits in the input integer. Here `l` is 32.  

## Space complexity

`O(l)` for the mask and new integer used for storing result.  

```java
public class Solution {
    // you need treat n as an unsigned value
    public int reverseBits(int n) {
        int mask = 1;
        int ret = 0;
        for (int i = 31; i >= 0; i--) {
            int curr = (mask & n) == 0 ? 0 : 1;
            ret = ret | (curr << i);
            mask = mask << 1;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
}
```

# Solution2: Optimized bit manipulation 

Instead of moving one bit each time, we could make use of a classic reversal algorithm. 

First, we reverse the first 16 bits and the second 16 bits of the integer. Then we reverse the first 8 and second 8 bits of each of the 16 bit piece. Next we reverse the first 4 and second 4 bits out of each 8 bits piece. ... Finally we reverse first and second bit of each 2 bits pieces. See the following example for better clarity.  

```
abcdefgh -> efghabcd -> ghefcdab -> hgfedcba
```

## Time complexity 

`O(logl)` in which `l` is the number of bits in the input integer. Here `l ` equals 32.  

## Space complexity 

`O(1)`. 

```java
public class Solution {
    // you need treat n as an unsigned value
    public int reverseBits(int n) {
        n = ((n & 0xffff0000) >>> 16) | ((n & 0x0000ffff) << 16);
        n = ((n & 0xff00ff00) >>> 8) | ((n & 0x00ff00ff) << 8);
        n = ((n & 0xf0f0f0f0) >>> 4) | ((n & 0x0f0f0f0f) << 4);
        n = ((n & 0xcccccccc) >>> 2) | ((n & 0x33333333) << 2);
        n = ((n & 0xaaaaaaaa) >>> 1) | ((n & 0x55555555) << 1);
        
        return n;
    }
}
```

## Solution3: Followup question

The followup question is: __if the function is called many times, how would you optimize it?__

We know that a typical optimization we can do for repeating requests is cache. We can use cache to store the results of commonly asked requests. However, question remains. Since we are dealing with 32-bit integers, there are at most `2^32` possible integers we can get. That is apparently too much unique keys for a cache system to handle. 

On top of solution 2, we see we are reversing bit-subarrays out of the original sequence of bits. And we can cache the intermediate results for smaller bit-array pieces. Then we only need to assemble them back reversely. Take how computer represents bits into consideration (i.e. bytes), we could split the integer into 4 _byte_. And for each byte, there are only `2^8` possible integers, or keys we should consider. It is true that we can further split the integer, say into 8 hexadecimal numbners, but the effect is similar. 

The decision of the length of the bit-array size to cache is essentially a trade-off between compute time and cache size. The smaller the bit-array size is, the more compute we need to do to assemble the pieces again afterwards. 

## Time complexity

`O(l/8)` with full cache hit. `O((l/8)*log8 + (l/8))` for no cache hit. `l` should be the number of bits in the input. Here `l` equals to 32.  

## Space complexity

`O(2^8)` for cache.  

```java
public class Solution {
    // you need treat n as an unsigned value
    private final Map<Byte, Integer> cache = new HashMap<>();
    public int reverseBits(int n) {
        byte[] pieces = new byte[4];
        
        // get all the byte pieces
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            pieces[i] = (byte)((n >>> 8 * i) & 0xff);
        }
        
        int ret = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            int reversed = reverseBits(pieces[i]);
            ret = ret | (reversed << ((3 - i) * 8));
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
    
    private int reverseBits(byte b) {
        if (cache.containsKey(b)) {
            return cache.get(b);
        }
        
        int n = (int)b;
        n = ((n & 0xf0)>>> 4) | ((n & 0x0f) << 4);
        n = ((n & 0xcc) >>> 2) | ((n & 0x33) << 2);
        n = ((n & 0xaa) >>> 1) | ((n & 0x55) << 1);
        
        cache.put(b, n);
        return n;
    }
}
```
