# Solution1: Split and add

Straightforwardly, we could just trim and split the input string based on one or more while spaces, producing the list of words contained in it. Then we just add each of the word reversely in the resulted word list. 

## Time complexity

`O(n)`, meaning it is proportional to the length of the input array. 

## Space complexity

`O(n)` for storing the resulting word list and the reversed string.  

```java
public class Solution
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        String[] words = s.trim().split("\\s+");
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = words.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            sb.append(words[i]).append(" ");
        }
        sb.append(words[0]);
        
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

# Solution2: Reverse whole string, then reverse every words

Two possible implementations.

## Implementation I

1. First construct a StringBuilder containing the reversed input string with all unnecessary spaces removed. In this process we only put an space when we encounter the start of each word in the original string. After the process we have added only one space between each word, with an extra space at the end of StringBuilder, which is removed afterwards.  
2. Now we reverse each word in the StringBuilder. This is simple since there is now only one space between each word, so everytime we find a space at position, say, `i`, it must between two words and we know the end of the previous word is `i-1` and the start of the next word is `i+1`.  
3. At the end of the iteration, we reverse the last word in the StringBuilder which does not satisfy our above condition and thus need to be taken care of separately.  

### Time complexity

`O(n+n) = O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input array.  

### Space complexity

`O(n)` for storing the StringBuilder. `O(1)` for runtime variables needed. 

```java
class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.length() == 0) return "";
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        // 1
        for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == ' ') continue;
            sb.append(s.charAt(i));
            if (s.charAt(i) != ' ' && (i == 0 || s.charAt(i - 1) == ' ')) {
                sb.append(' ');
            }
        }
        if (sb.length() == 0) return ""; // if the string only contains space, this StringBuilder would be empty
        sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1); // remove extra space at the end
        
        // 2
        int start = 0, end = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < sb.length(); i++) {
            if (sb.charAt(i) == ' ') {
                end = i - 1;
                reverseWords(sb, start, end);
                start = i + 1;
            }
        }
        reverseWord(sb, start, sb.length() - 1);
        
        return sb.toString();
    }
    
    private void reverseWord(StringBuilder sb, int start, int end) {
        while (start <= end) {
            char tmp = sb.charAt(start);
            sb.setCharAt(start, sb.charAt(end));
            sb.setCharAt(end, tmp);
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation II

1. Reverse the whole string. 
2. Then reverse each word.
3. Finally get rid of all unnecessary spaces.

### Time complexity

`O(n+n+n) = O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input string.  

### Space complexity

`O(n+n) = O(n)` for storing the StringBuilder and the char array. The char array is not necessary. 

```java
public class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.length() == 0) return new String();
        char[] chs = s.toCharArray();
        
        reverse(chs, 0, chs.length - 1); //reverse the whole string
        reverseWords(chs, chs.length - 1); //reverse each word in the string
        
        return cleanSpaces(chs, chs.length - 1); //get rid of unneeded spaces
    }
    
    private void reverse(char[] chs, int start, int end) {
        while (start < end) {
            char c = chs[start];
            chs[start] = chs[end];
            chs[end] = c;
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }
    
    private void reverseWords(char[] chs, int length) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i <= length) {
            //skip all spaces to find the start of a word
            //i < j is the start point of this loop, which is to start from the start character of previous word and end at the start character of current word
            while (i < j || (i <= length && chs[i] == ' ')) i++; 
            //skip all characters to find the end of a word
            //j < i is the start point of this loop, which is to start from the end character of previous word and end at the end character of current word
            while (j < i || (j <= length && chs[j] != ' ')) j++;
            reverse(chs, i, j - 1);
        }
    }
    
    private String cleanSpaces(char[] chs, int length) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        
        while (j <= length) {
            while (j <= length && chs[j] == ' ') j++; //skip all spaces
            while (j <= length && chs[j] != ' ') chs[i++] = chs[j++]; //move words forward to take place of spaces
            while (j <= length && chs[j] == ' ') j++; //skip all spaces, avoid adding extra spaces if it the end of the string
            if (j <= length) chs[i++] = ' ';
        }
        
        return new String(chs).substring(0, i);
    }
}
```
