# Solution1: Store numbers in HashMap

In order to get the 2 sum out of a given array, we either need to sort the input array and perform a 2 pointer searching, or we need to store all the numbers in a HashMap and looking for if the paired number of a all the numbers in the array exists. 

Here, since we are constantly performing `add` and `find` operation, sorting is inrealistic since each time a new number is being inserted, we need to re-sort the array. Hence, we have the following algorithm.

1. Initialize a HashMap, a max and a min.  
2. When call `add`, we put it in the HashMap along with its frequency. Then update max and min correspondingly.  
3. When call `find`, 
  1. first check if the given `value` is greater than `max * 2` or smaller than `min * 2`. If this is the case, then we can fail fast as there won't be any numbers satisfy the 2 sum condition.  
  2. then, for every distinct number `i` in the HashMap, check if `value - i` exists in the HashMap. If so, return true. 
  3. if we cannot find a match, return false. 
  
## Time complexity

`add(int number)`: `O(1)`  
`find(int value)`: `O(n)` since we need to check for existance of the target using `O(1)` time for each of the `n` numbers we have. 

## Space complexity

`O(n)` when `n` numbers is added. 

```java
class TwoSum {
    Map<Integer, Integer> nums;
    int max;
    int min;

    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public TwoSum() {
        nums = new HashMap<>();
        max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    }
    
    /** Add the number to an internal data structure.. */
    public void add(int number) {
        nums.put(number, nums.getOrDefault(number, 0) + 1);
        max = Math.max(max, number);
        min = Math.min(min, number);
    }
    
    /** Find if there exists any pair of numbers which sum is equal to the value. */
    public boolean find(int value) {
        boolean result = false;
        if (value > max * 2l || value < min * 2l) return result;
        for (int ele : nums.keySet()) {
            int target = value - ele;
            if (target != ele) {
                result = result | nums.containsKey(target);
            } else { // target == value
                result = result | (nums.containsKey(target) && nums.get(target) >= 2);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}

/**
 * Your TwoSum object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * TwoSum obj = new TwoSum();
 * obj.add(number);
 * boolean param_2 = obj.find(value);
 */
 ```
