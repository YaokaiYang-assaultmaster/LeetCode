# Solution1: Straightforward Solution

Given that all the numbers are within the range `[1, N]` where `N` is the length of the input, we can have a HashSet to store all the numbers that has appeared within the input array. 

Then we could iterate through all numbers from `1` to `N` and find out the numbers that has not been stored in the HashSet yet, which would be the numbers we are looking for. 

## Time complexity

`O(2*N) = O(N)`. 

## Space complexity

`O(N)` for the extra HashSet. 

```Java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findDisappearedNumbers(int[] nums) {
        Set<Integer> existed = new HashSet<>();
        
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) return list;
        
        for (int ele : nums) {
            existed.add(ele);
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= nums.length; i++) {
            if (!existed.contains(i)) {
                list.add(i);
            }
        }
        
        return list;
    }
}
```

# Solution2: Inplace state keeping

In the above solution we used a HashSet for keeping the existence status of the numbers in the array. However, given the condition that all the numbers in the array are within the range `[1, N]`, we can figure out some way to save the extra space used by storing the existence (or not) state of each number in place using the input array. 

How could we do that? Well, we could use the symbol of the numbers in the array. I.e., for `nums[i]`, we could negate the number at index `nums[i]-1` in the `nums` array. The "negating" here at each index is used as the storage for the existence state, as a replacement of the HashSet used in Solution1. 

```Java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findDisappearedNumbers(int[] nums) {
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        if (nums == null ||  nums.length == 0) return res;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[Math.abs(nums[i]) - 1] > 0) {  // the value can be negative after negating, hence we need to use abs() function. 
                nums[Math.abs(nums[i]) - 1] *= -1;
            }
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > 0) res.add(i + 1);
        }
        
        return res;
    }
}
```

## Time complexity

`O(2*N) = O(N)`,since we iterated through the input array twice. 

## Space complexity

`O(1)`

# Solution3: Inplace swap/sort

Instead of marking the existence of each number, we can also swapping each of the numbers in the array to it's right position, similar to bucket sort. Then the positions of which the number is not appropriate (`nums[i] != i + 1`) indicate the numbers that are missing.

The only glitch here is to make sure the while loop has an exit condition that takes care of the case when we left with the same numbers being swapped again and again, cause remember there can be numbers appear more than once. In this case there is no suitable number for this position so we stop the swapping. 

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findDisappearedNumbers(int[] nums) {
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) return res;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != i + 1) swap(nums, i);
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != i + 1) res.add(i + 1);
        }
        
        return res;
    }
    
    private void swap(int[] nums, int i) {
        while (nums[i] != i + 1 && nums[i] != nums[nums[i] - 1]) { // there can be numbers appear twice so we need to check if we are swapping the same numbers to avoid infinite loop.
            int tmp = nums[nums[i] -1];
            nums[nums[i] - 1] = nums[i];
            nums[i] = tmp;
        }
    }
}
```

## Time complexity

`O(2*N) = O(N)`. The while loop might looks disguising, but even in the worst case when every number is in wrong position, we will only do at most `O(N)` swaps. So the total time is still `O(N)`. 

## Space complexity

`O(1)`.
